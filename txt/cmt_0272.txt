Service and drinks choice fine but their food is always questionable. On the way out had the tasting menu which was good, even had two dishes repeated but on the return chose the chicken in a mushroom sauce! This was disgusting and after two bites sent it back. This is not the first time BA's food has been suspect either, their club Europe service to Gibraltar also serves up light cold snacks though charging up to \u00a3750 return for a 2.5hour flight. For those looking to fly BA, the lounges, aircraft and staff are good to go but the food needs to be improved.", "air_title": "British Airways ", "Customer_name": "Bob Kumar"}
