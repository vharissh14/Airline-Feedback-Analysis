Thus I had to join 30-40 person long check-in queues at 2 am, taking an hour to clear. There was a long layover of 14 hours in Bogota, so connections via Star Alliance are not convenient. The seat assigned for the 11-hour Lufthansa LH 543 flight BOG-FRA on Sunday 24 August was totally different from one I selected online - 24D versus 55K, and at odds with what I had requested on booking months earlier and as stated permanently on my Silver frequent flyer record. I asked for the seat to be changed but was told that this could not be done on the Avianca system, only in La Paz by Lufthansa, despite both airlines being part of Star Alliance. At Bogota airport I was informed initially by Lufthansa staff that this was due to overbooking and 'nothing' could be done. They also tried to put the blame on me for not informing them earlier or checking-in earlier. I had done my online check-in 24 hours ahead of Avianca flight which was about 38 hours ahead of the Lufthansa one - well before most others would have checked-in and so should have got my selected seat. I was then told of a 'special offer' of a business class upgrade of USD600 - another profit-maximising effort instead of service-recovery of a complimentary upgrade or even a USD100 one which I might have accepted in desperation. The seat was finally changed grudgingly - without apology or even a smile - at the gate to 55G at a part of plane and side I did not like at all.", "air_title": "Lufthansa ", "Customer_name": "A Thomas"}
