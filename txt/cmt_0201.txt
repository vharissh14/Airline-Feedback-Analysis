Cabin staff were attentive and helpful, flight was on time, cabin spotless, food excellent, seats comfortable. My return flight economy again good, helpful attendants, food was fine, seats appropriate and clean. Even though the flight was at a time very high winds were present in UK the landing was skilfully executed, and for me as a nervous flyer, really I could not have asked for two better flights. I obtained online excellent prices for both flight prices relatively last minute too! No hesitation in flying BA at anytime.", "air_title": "British Airways ", "Customer_name": "H Wilson"}
