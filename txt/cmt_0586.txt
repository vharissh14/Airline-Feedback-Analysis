Seat, service, food, and were exemplary. Could not fault any point of the service. While I did not get to fully experience the flat-bed that Air New Zealand offers, when I had the seat fully reclined I nearly fell asleep. This is a first. Did not use IFE, although by the looks of things it was modern, with a great selection of movies/TV shows.", "air_title": "Air New Zealand ", "Customer_name": "F Pearce"}
