For going, took Jet Airways 9W 09 on the 737-800. Flight was for the same price as the one hour earlier 9W 11 on the A330 for the same SIN-BOM flight and yet the PTV was barely working. It kept on switching on and off. The passenger beside me could barely use hers with the very poor touch screen. Content was minimum and not what I expected from India's premium airline. Food was good but we weren't even served the usual tea/coffee. Seats were uncomfortable. Coming back, flew the A330 On 9W 12 BOM-SIN. PTV was MUCH better this time round and seats were a much bigger improvement over the 738 flight but food wasn't as good. FA's were pleasant and helpful on both flights. While definitely India's best premium airline when compared to Air India, it still doesn't live up to the much higher standards of Kingfisher Airlines when I flew it on the same sector few years ago which was on an A320 but the experience of KF was still definitely 5* and better. If SQ and 9W have the same pricing on the SIN-India routes, would recommend no doubt SQ. If prices are very different for both with SQ being much (500SGD?) more expensive, then Jet does still give a pleasant flight for the sector. Got an amazing deal on Jet for this sector this time though.", "air_title": "Jet Airways ", "Customer_name": "C Thadani"}
