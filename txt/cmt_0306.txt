Immaculate refurbished aircraft, seats very comfortable. Great breakfast, unexpected, from Glasgow and tasty filling sandwiches on the Prague flights. Only quibble is very scanty snack on evening flight back to Glasgow. Very good value package city break to Prague from Glasgow.", "air_title": "British Airways ", "Customer_name": "S Scott"}
