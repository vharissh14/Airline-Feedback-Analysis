I am a vegetarian but eat dairy and yet again I was served the most disgusting food and snacks sorely lacking in flavour and variety. It is always the same and having taken 4 long haul flights with Lufthansa in the last month the meals are predictable and a major let down every time. I take my own food on board depending on allowances at airports but the vegetarian option (lacto-ovo) is lacking dairy and it is very frustrating to see others getting food that makes me even more hungry. Further, the seats are very uncomfortable compared to other airlines with leg room appearing to shrink. Flying with other airlines I never suffer back ache but do on Lufthansa flights. I have seen standards drop over the years and find partner/star alliance partners are usually better. The staff were very brisk and unfriendly on the latest flight snatching ear phones from my hands 30 minutes before landing and knocking my friends arms passing in the aisles with carts constantly. The onboard entertainment again is limited compared to other airlines with less choice in both films, TV and languages.", "air_title": "Lufthansa ", "Customer_name": "E Matthews"}
