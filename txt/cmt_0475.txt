Wonderful experience travelling with two pre-school age children from Gisborne to Auckland and then on to Christchurch. The whole way was a pleasure with the pilots making our kids day by waving to them from the cockpit and the air hostess that let my daughter handout the sweets. I will point out the plane was running slightly late so it would have been understandable for them to be feeling slightly rushed and not accommodating but staff went above and beyond in all aspects.", "air_title": "Air New Zealand ", "Customer_name": "Kate Fraser"}
