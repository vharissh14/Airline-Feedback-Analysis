My first time in Premium Economy. I will never fly business again. The leg space was great, the seat did not incline like in business but still enough to enable me to sleep. The service was ok+, of course not like in business but still very good, food and drinks were more than sufficient. I also have to mention the excellent service at the gate. I had been on the waiting list for an upgrade to business which had gone lost though. In premium economy there were only middle seats left which I didn't like. The attendant behind the desk looked into it and found a window seat for me. After some terrible experiences with other airlines (especially British Airways whose economy class has become a joke ever since they decided to divide their aircraft into five (!) different classes) this was an enjoyable experience.", "air_title": "Lufthansa ", "Customer_name": "Michael Esser"}
