Our flight yesterday went beyond just \"good service,\" it was excellent service. This is not necessarily because anything out of the ordinary happened on our flight but rather because our Air New Zealand pilots and cabin attendant just did the ordinary things particularly well. No fuss, no bother, just professionalism. We felt comfortable, happy and safe, and when it is all said and done that's why one chooses to fly with a particular airline.", "air_title": "Air New Zealand ", "Customer_name": "Peter van Zoggel"}
