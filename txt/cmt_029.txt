Checked in online on the first sector and got an emergency exit seat. Web check-in queue was not open in BOM - seemed strange as it was a busy time. Flight on time and service okay. Food served was terrible. Delhi to Bombay was delayed and we ended up waiting one hour at the gate before we could board. Service on this sector was okay. Finally arrived 1.5 hours late.", "air_title": "Jet Airways ", "Customer_name": "Rishad Patell"}
