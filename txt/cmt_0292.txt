Why do we need to have those ridiculous lights in cabins on so bright? Chairs seem to be slimmer though and the last row practically is the first row of premium economy where all the new babies inevitably travel. Not great for business class sleeping and poor design there. Great service and food and beverages continue to be high quality, great menus, also good entertainment selection. Didn't even notice takeoff (which was delayed) as movies etc available before take off. Very good.", "air_title": "British Airways ", "Customer_name": "N Bhettay"}
