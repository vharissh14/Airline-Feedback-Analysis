Lounge at Gatwick was good and staff very attentive, no lounge at Catania airport and given vouchers instead which we got a rotten cup of coffee from the BA approved cafe next to the non Schengen passport control. Flights both ways were good and we liked the Pilot pointing out Lake Geneva and telling us about our route so nicely. The return flight back to LGW, the Captain was hard to hear, and wasn't so interesting. That aside, on both journeys, we felt well looked after, with charming FAs. The food was also good too, and we landed on time. Baggage came very quickly at LGW, but at Catania airport it was a bit of a carnival! I'm afraid Catania airport is the worst airport I've been through, but there you go! I think it is one of the joys of travelling.", "air_title": "British Airways ", "Customer_name": "Kathleen Kirby"}
