IFE that was ancient and didn't work properly. I really don't enjoy having the passengers seat so close to my face, when they recline. Not an enjoyable trip. Please update your cabins. Passengers pay good money and shouldn't be treated like this, especially when there are plenty of options for getting to YVR.", "air_title": "Air New Zealand ", "Customer_name": "S Campbell"}
