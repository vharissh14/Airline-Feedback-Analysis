The entertainment system is phenomenal. I did not run out of movies to choose from, the whole plane ride was not enough for me to watch all the movies available unlike the other airlines with limited movies. Other airlines like United charges for entertainment access (ridiculous). The food is filling and the unlimited wine helped. The seats are very comfy with plenty of leg room, the only problem is getting out when the people seating in front of you all have their seats reclined, it gets pretty tricky. Nevertheless, I will certainly chose Air New Zealand again if given the chance.", "air_title": "Air New Zealand ", "Customer_name": "J Marcos"}
