Buenos Aries to LHR, a 13 hour flight. I really didn't have any complaints about this flight, or BA, but against the other 7 airlines in 3 months it was pretty average. The FA's were helpful, the food was OK, the only really bad thing was the AVOD. Half a dozen new releases and a dozen or so older films. Likewise the album selection- pretty poor. The 777 was around 6 years old so maybe was due for an upgrade. To be fare I'm comparing BA against Emirates, so no contest really!", "air_title": "British Airways ", "Customer_name": "Chris Matthews"}
