More often than not the plane is parked on the tarmac vs. at a gate and there are inordinate delays as the busses don't leave till they are absolutely full - if you are travelling first or business and have got off first or had priority boarding - it really makes no difference as you end up waiting in the bus. Also the amount of time that it takes to transfer gates during transit and also go through immigration make it easily one of the worse international hubs now.", "air_title": "Lufthansa ", "Customer_name": "Tarun Gulati"}
