The contrast was non-existent, and the resolution appalling. It was like watching a grainy black and white picture that was so dark you had to strain your eyes to see (when the cabin lights were off, when they were on, it was impossible to see!) It wasn't just my seat, my colleagues was the same and I could see walking around the cabin that this is the standard of TVs in your cabin, not just a problem with mine. The tray table was so flimsy it was barely usable without using your knee to prop it up. The table had about a 15 degree angle on it and drinks slid off twice during my flight - it wasn't even turbulent. Power sockets on a flight originating in the UK, and run by a UK airline should be UK sockets, not US sockets! The food was adequate, but nothing special, I've had equivalent meals in economy class on other airlines, and other business class meals have far exceeded this! Furthermore, my side salad came out frozen not just a bit cold, but frozen solid! It had clearly been kept too close to the chilling unit! Finally, when the Club World cabin ran out of tonic water, there was no attempt made by the cabin crew to go and check the trolleys in a different cabin it was a case of sorry, there's none in this trolley so you can't have any. All in all, this isn't the level of service that I expect when paying nearly \u00a33,000 for a flight. It was my first time flying Club with BA, and I had expected a level of service equivalent to business class with other airlines, how wrong I was!", "air_title": "British Airways ", "Customer_name": "Charlie Walker"}
