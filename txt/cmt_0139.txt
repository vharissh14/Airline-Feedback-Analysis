Great value for money. Outbound flight was on refurbished A320. Great new cabin, comfortable seats - with enough legroom and great new lighting. On return was another A320 class - not refurbished. Definitely will be good once all are refitted.", "air_title": "British Airways ", "Customer_name": "G O'Neill"}
