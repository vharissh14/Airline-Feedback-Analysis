First the good news - check-in was quick, flight was on time. Next the bad part - they really ought to stop flying a 737-800 for 6 hours on this route. Seats were cramped, entertainment was poor and the cabin crew though friendly were pathetic. They did not have the VLML meal that I had pre-ordered and confirmed with them twice before the flight. They forgot to serve the bread with the meal and one lady came by sheepishly with it after people had finished eating. Clearly their cabin crew training standards are dubious, so is their catering.", "air_title": "Jet Airways ", "Customer_name": "Purna Ananth"}
