Mixed fleet crew very friendly and enthusiastic. Food onboard was excellent, received my first choice and the club kitchen was stocked with a selection of delicious sweet and savoury snacks. The upper deck was excellent as it was very quiet and private with approx 20 seats in the forward section. Entertainment very good on a larger screen than found on 747/777. Cabin very clean and in general felt very fresh and new. The only gripe is still having to climb over the passenger seated in the aisle with the ying yang layout.", "air_title": "British Airways ", "Customer_name": "R Beech"}
