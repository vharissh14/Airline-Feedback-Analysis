Destination was Frankfurt, Germany. Upgraded on the return flight, which was Frankfurt to Dulles on Lufthansa 418, on December 13, 2014. Lufthansa has always been our preferred carrier, but the new seating in economy was on the verge of intolerable. The way the seat attaches to the floor greatly limits what you can carry on, there is no foot room. Knee room to the next row is minimal, especially if the person in the seat in front leans back. The seats are narrow and not comfortable. They are squeezed together so much that the seat pocket in front of you can barely hold one bottle of water. Food has greatly degraded over the past few years. I feel degraded by being in economy class. It is insulting to pay for such a horribly uncomfortable trip. I felt like baggage being crammed into the baggage hold, and that I had no value as a customer. Our return flight was much better as we unhappily upgraded to economy plus, but we greatly resented being forced to pay more money just to have a seat that was adequate for an overseas flight.", "air_title": "Lufthansa ", "Customer_name": "John Vollbrecht"}
