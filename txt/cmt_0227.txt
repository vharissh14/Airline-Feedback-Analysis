Excellent SLOW lounge at CPT with outstanding food and 'loos with a view'. Reasonable flight to JNB although 737 pretty tatty. BA Galleries lounge at JNB not a patch on SLOW lounge. 2/2 layout on 747 upper deck felt superior to 2/3/2 on A380 outward flight, particularly as less than 50% full. FAs pleasant and food service managed well. Food better than usual. IFE not as good as Emirates and screen inferior to Club World on A380. Flat- bed seats okay although narrow and hard.", "air_title": "British Airways ", "Customer_name": "David Ellis"}
