All the flights were operated on time on standard A321, without AVOD. I am 189 cms tall and find LH seats hard but I somehow fit in, cost cutting can be clearly seen. At all flights, informative announcement from cabin. Toilets on LH can inconsistent, dirty on some segments. On both flights to RIX, crew ran out of sandwiches so we had to take leftover croissants. The crew are doing an acceptable job but they need to work on their snack service. This segment is 2 hours and has enough time to serve a decent snack and please, also consider vegetarians. Even though I pay for a premium airline, I always have to buy a salad or sandwich from the airport to eat inside the aircraft, just because sandwiches are either with chicken or eggs. No vegetarian option and one can't even book a meal for long EU flights.", "air_title": "Lufthansa ", "Customer_name": "V Ladhani"}
