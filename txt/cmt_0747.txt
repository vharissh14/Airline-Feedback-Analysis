It was the worst travel I've ever done. The airplane was a A320, but seats in business class were like economy and considering this is a 4 hours flight, this not good. No IFE on board neither shared screens or PTV. I wouldn't recommend LH for these medium haul routes.", "air_title": "Lufthansa ", "Customer_name": "Carriglio Mirco"}
