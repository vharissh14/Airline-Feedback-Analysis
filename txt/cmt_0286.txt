Difficult to quite place why a 787 is better but it is - noise in particular is lower. The 'enhanced' Club World is a bit longer than normal with a different colour scheme. A very good dinner and a new IFE system with lots of choice. As normal with BA, service is good. Almost a perfect flight.", "air_title": "British Airways ", "Customer_name": "Guy Senior"}
