Flight left promptly on a dreary day in Frankfurt. Seating in row 83 was a bit tight but I had ample shoulder room at the window thanks to the curve of the plane's fuselage. Two full meals were served over the 10 hour flight and the crew was pleasant and the flight was amazingly smooth at 40,000 feet.", "air_title": "Lufthansa ", "Customer_name": "D Jennings"}
