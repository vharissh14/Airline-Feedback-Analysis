An uneventful journey with BA but their Boeing 747 from Vancouver was a flashback to the 1990's. Dated interior with cold colours, old seats that recline practically into your face making the already cramped space even more uncomfortable - you could also occasionally feel the person's knees pushing into the back of your own seat. The in-flight entertainment was equally old with a blurry screen and limited choice of entertainment. The cabin crew were courteous and friendly. Arrival and transfer in BA's Terminal 5 was very smooth and relaxing. The connecting flight to Amsterdam was a modern Airbus A319 with bright and comfortable interior/seating. Unless BA revamp their ageing 747 fleet, consider fly with Virgin, Air Canada or even Air Transat for the Vancouver-London route.", "air_title": "British Airways ", "Customer_name": "T Harvey"}
