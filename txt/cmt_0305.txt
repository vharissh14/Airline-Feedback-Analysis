Very smooth online check-in and seat selection. Lightly loaded flights, so I ended up with an empty seat next to me on every leg of the journey. The catering was pretty basic, the usual crisps, biscuits or nuts, but a full complimentary bar. Every flight was on time or early - when the return flight arrived at LHR ahead of schedule, they even agreed to rebook me on an earlier connection to MAN, which then also arrived early at MAN. All in all, an impressive experience.", "air_title": "British Airways ", "Customer_name": "T Hanan"}
