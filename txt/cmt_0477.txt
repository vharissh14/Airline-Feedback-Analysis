Paid a small fee for a preferred bulkhead seat. It was one of the most uncomfortable seats I have flown. No space to extend my legs (I flew bulkhead many times before but the seat has never been so close to the wall) and since they installed the control for the entertainment system inside the arm rest it was also extremely narrow. I am 6\"2 and athletic. I can't imagine what this seat would be like for an overweight. When I complained to the flight attendant she said 'at least nobody is going to recline their seat'. I was aware of that and I believe that was the whole point of paying extra. Additional issues: the plane looked so old it was sad, only one suitcase to check in even on an international flight, food was less than mediocre. I would definitely fly Hawaiian airlines on my next trip. On top of all this I did not get any mileage credit on united on my return flight. I did get it on the way there so it was not the type of ticket.", "air_title": "Air New Zealand ", "Customer_name": "Guzelbeyoglu Mehmet"}
