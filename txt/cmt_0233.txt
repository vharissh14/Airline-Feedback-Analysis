The flight from Manchester was delayed and then, on arrival at LHR, the boarding passes, which were fine at MAN, were no good at LHR. We had to queue for over 2 hours to get more printed. Others with the same problem missed their main flights! The staff at LHR are rude, jobsworth who take great pleasure in causing the maximum discomfort. The 747 seats on the LHR to LV flights were terrible, like small deck chairs. Any leg/knee movement from the person behind was felt, even with the pillow between me and the seat back. Compared with US Air the seats are much smaller and far more basic. Seating totally unsuitable for long haul flights. The entire cabin is extremely cramped, the aisles are so narrow, that anyone who is not slim, tends to bang into your seat, every time they pass. BA brought a whole new meaning to \"cattle class\" The cabin staff were efficient and professional, the food was fine. I am not a large person, certainly not overweight but I was badly cramped. I would never choose BA for a long haul flight again. We travel from Manchester to Las Vegas 2 or 3 times a year. BA is by far the worst carrier we have flown with, especially when you add in the extra costs for seat selection etc. Very Poor!", "air_title": "British Airways ", "Customer_name": "W Brash"}
