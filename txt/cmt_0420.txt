These aircraft are looking very tatty now - seats worn, cabins grimy and dingy. The 'food' was a soggy half-wrap with a filling-free miniature roll - it was unacceptable on a 2hr45m flight. No choice offered by the cabin crew even though they had 3 options. The claim that their food offering is appropriate to the time of day is hogwash - we were served exactly the same thing at 10.30am on the outbound flight as at midnight on the return. Although we benefited from it on this trip, BA need to change their hand luggage policy. There simply isn't space for 150+ passengers to bring 2 bags, which caused a lot of angst particularly on the return trip (both flights were completely full). On the upside, both flights were on time and the crews were friendly - the return crew dealt well with a potentially disruptive family group.", "air_title": "British Airways ", "Customer_name": "Andrew Duff"}
