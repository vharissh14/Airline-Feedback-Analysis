The 747 to SFO must have been 20 odd years old and looked it. Ancient IFE with tiny screen, virtually inaudible sound and minuscule choice. Seats were ok, actually moderately comfortable for economy, staff better than they used to be. The flight from Cairo on a much newer Airbus A320 in a long haul configuration was much better. Big IFE screen, lots of movie choice, comfortable seat, charming cabin crew, shows what could be with a newer fleet. As a Brit, this itinerary was a rare chance to see what transferring through LHR is like, well, I just made my connection but why oh why have they designed such a massive T5 only to put a bottle neck of 5 or ten transfer desks for the tens of thousands changing planes every few hours? That transfer hall should be massive and full of staff, rather than anxious travellers fretting about missing their connection. If I were BA I would sort that or else keep losing transfers to Schiphol or CDG. Overall, I get the impression BA is living off the captive market London provides- hundreds of thousands of very rich people wanting long haul direct flying for which there is no competition. If there is ever global de-regulation BA's long haul business will go the way of short haul with Emirates playing easyJet's role this time.", "air_title": "British Airways ", "Customer_name": "R Franklin"}
