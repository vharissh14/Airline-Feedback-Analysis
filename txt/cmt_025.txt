I booked in business class but they overbooked my flight to Mumbai so I got upgraded. The first class suite on the 777 is pretty good although not all good as the suites in emirates, Singapore airlines, Etihad or American airlines. But overall good. The seat goes to a full 180 degree bed. Very comfortable. The staff is very helpful and have a high service standard. The food tasted good and fresh unlike some airlines first class. Overall its a good ad comfortable first class. Its not as good as others but it is also cheaper and definitely value for money.", "air_title": "Jet Airways ", "Customer_name": "Joeseph Williamson"}
