The check-in service at LHR was exceptional and one of the best check-in experiences I have had. As I was a premium customer the agent gave me an exit row seat and kept the next seat to me vacant. The service changed for the worst in the departure lounge. First of all they announced boarding for business class and Star Alliance Gold customers. I skipped over to that line to board, only to be hauled up by an abrupt and loud ground crew member to be told in front of everyone that \"we are only boarding business class and Gold Star Alliance customers\". I had pleasure in telling her I was a Star Alliance Gold Member (actually Elite with Air New Zealand) and I then boarded. In this day and age no one should ever presume that only people wearing Savile Row suits and Italian shoes are the Premium customers. The rest of the flight was typical LH, clean plane, efficient and professional cabin crew, with pilots getting us there before time and baggage being unloaded within minutes.", "air_title": "Lufthansa ", "Customer_name": "Richard Connett"}
