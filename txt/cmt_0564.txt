Was on the 'works\" fare and it does work. Great wine and food selection. Staff were pleasant and seemed to be interact with most customers. The only disappointing part was the entertainment choice. The plane was old and had to use the remote to change channels. Overall a good flight from SYD-AKL and back.", "air_title": "Air New Zealand ", "Customer_name": "Elton Rana"}
