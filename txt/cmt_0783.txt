Flight was operated by an older A340-300, which was in very good condition and had nice inflight entertainment on big personal screens (much better than on Lufthansa's A330s at the moment). IFE featured loads of movies and fancy stuff such as real time speed / altitude. Flight departed about 1 hour late. Nevertheless, I could easily catch my connection to Vienna. Food was alright, could have been a little more, though. Drinks were always available. Cabin crew did a great job, very friendly and professional. Seat comfort was good for Economy Class, enough legroom and I like the 2-4-2 seating. Changing in Dusseldorf was very convenient (small distances and a nice airport). I'm usually very satisfied with Lufthansa.", "air_title": "Lufthansa ", "Customer_name": "A Bergmann"}
