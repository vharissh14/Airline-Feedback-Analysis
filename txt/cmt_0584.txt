Two smooth on time flights with the ATR 72 offering more comfort than many short haul jets. Service friendly and professional. Water/coffee/tea and biscuit offered as is the norm for short haul flights within NZ. Some readers bemoan this, but would you get similar on a bus or train trip of one hour? Air NZ still offers boiled sweets prior to landing, which is a simple but nice touch. Luggage delivered promptly at both ends and check-in efficient too, whether assisted (Napier) or through automated machine (Auckland). Auckland Airport domestic terminal is a little tired and dull, but it still works.", "air_title": "Air New Zealand ", "Customer_name": "Richard Brown"}
