Domestic flights were perfectly competent, international legs on a B777-300 were on a par with BA and Thai business class products. Seats good, proper flat bed and very nice to have the crew make up the seat into a bed with a padded topper. On board ents a little sparse compared to other airlines but sufficient for a 10 hour flight. Skyteam lounge at LHR pretty good, lounges in India consistently lousy. Food decent enough. All in all it did what it said on the tin (all the flights were bang on time) and I'd be very happy to try them again in business.", "air_title": "Jet Airways ", "Customer_name": "M Cowan"}
