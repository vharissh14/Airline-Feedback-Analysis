Design of seats meant that legroom was perhaps more acceptable than many airlines provide in economy. Flights were on time. That is the good bit. On the other side of the coin the flight crew were unfriendly. They did what they had to but with no sense of enjoying their jobs. No assistance given to those who needed help with luggage. They just stood and watched whilst other passengers helped out. Very strange and in contrast to the general attitude we encountered during a delightful holiday in India. Poorest food on a long haul flight since Delta served up something inedible about 15 years ago. Entertainment way behind the competition. We will certainly return to India but it won't be on Jet Airways.", "air_title": "Jet Airways ", "Customer_name": "Stilton Michael"}
