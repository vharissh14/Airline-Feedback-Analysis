Usual ice cream before arrival in BOM always comes as a welcome surprise, but despite the 9-hour flight being only half-full, cabin crew failed to bring round any drinks, apart from the main drink/meal-service, passengers were expected to go and fetch their own from the galley. Is Jet now a self-service airline ? Perhaps the cabin-crew might tell us they won't be serving any extra drinks, and to come and get our own, in future? Gate-allocation for BOM-BKK was changed at least twice, from 85A (written on boarding-pass) to 85C (on flight-departure screens) to 85B (eventually found after sitting waiting at the wrong gate for 30 mins), it was a shambles which can only cause passengers worry or even cause them to miss boarding. If this happens again, perhaps Jet might actually announce it over the speakers, or send staff to alert passengers still waiting at the previously-indicated gates?", "air_title": "Jet Airways ", "Customer_name": "R Bell"}
