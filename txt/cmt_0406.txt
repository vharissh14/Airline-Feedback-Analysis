We flew from London to Calgary, Alberta - a long cramped ride. It was on the new Dreamliner with very tight seats, the people in front had to raise their seats when lunch was served as the trays hit our stomachs! Service almost non-existent even on a 9 hour trip! Beverages served once and then at dinner the cart with wine got two rows before us (row35) and they quickly returned it to the back as they felt they were late with the coffee, didn't even ask us whether we would like anything. When the coffee did come it was lukewarm. There was not one good thing about our flight. We will never travel British Airways again.", "air_title": "British Airways ", "Customer_name": "DesBrisay Marlyn"}
