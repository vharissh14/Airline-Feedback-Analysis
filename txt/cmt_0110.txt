Jet Airways flight 9W 0118 on 31 December 2013 from Mumbai to London had two kids in the section who did not have a seat of their own and shared seating with 4 adults spread through out the cabin during the entire duration of the flight. The kids screamed the place down and ran amok throughout the cabin. I could not sleep at all on a nearly 10 hour flight. Second. The lounge experience. Lousy is the best description I can come up with. Both outward flight from London and Return flight from Mumbai lounges were shared and were poor at best. Third entertainment. My seat 11A had a non functioning screen! It was locked in a position in which nothing could be viewed. The cabin crew apologised but obviously could do nothing about it. Meal choices. Very limited. And finally cabin comfort. The cabin is laid out in herring bone fashion the fold flat bed does not accommodate a 1.85 meter man. the d\u00e9cor is old fashioned in beige and brown. Shame on you Jet. Old planes, indifferent service and clearly unaware that there is competition on this leg. You really do not expect me to be on board your aircraft again.", "air_title": "Jet Airways ", "Customer_name": "Rajendrakumar C Patel"}
