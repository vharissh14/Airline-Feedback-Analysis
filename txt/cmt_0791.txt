This flight was supposed to have new business class. The video was non-functional and my seat would not operate properly. We were in 4A and 4C. At the end of the flight the flight attendant found a large water bottle in the mechanism inside the seat cushion. Headphones were loose attached to the console and not in separated plastic bags. Drinks were horrible. The flight attendants were nice. The stewardess told us at the end of the flight that planes were switched in Frankfurt.Our flight from Frankfurt to Athens was on a 321 airbus. Business class was 3 thin coach seats with no one in the middle seat.", "air_title": "Lufthansa ", "Customer_name": "Edwin Eisenberg"}
