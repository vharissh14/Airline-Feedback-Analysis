Crew was excellent was start to finish. However, those new seats are a catastrophe. There is not enough leg room, they hardly recline and it's not possible work on a laptop. That's in Business Class. It is just like Easyjet seating, but with a business fare price tag. Food consisted of some finger sandwiches and a scone with jam. Really? The flight gets in just before 19.00 hrs local time. Wouldn't a light dinner be more appropriate? Terrible, disappointing experience. These new seats have to go and food must improve.", "air_title": "British Airways ", "Customer_name": "R Schroeder"}
