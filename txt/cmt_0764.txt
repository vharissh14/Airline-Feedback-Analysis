The first class lounge in Munich was very pleasant with the usual high quality food offerings. The food onboard was good when traveling from Boston to Munich on 10/17 and outstanding on the way back - Munich to Boston on 10/26. Service also very good Boston-Munich and absolutely outstanding on the Munich-Boston flight. The flight attendant on the Munich-Boston flight was fast, efficient and very pleasant. Entertainment was OK, we both care more for recent movies than the latest releases but I understand it's difficult to please everyone. I'd say that the Wi-Fi should be free in first class. The Munich-Prague and Prague-Munich segments in business class were pretty much standard, the Munich-Prague flight was quite delayed, fortunately for us the Prague-Munich flight was on time. All in all, a pleasant experience.", "air_title": "Lufthansa ", "Customer_name": "Jarolim Petr"}
