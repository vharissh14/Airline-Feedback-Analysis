Wonderful plane, slept for a number of hours (which for me is all but unheard of). Food much better than I was expecting, considering that WT+ is supposed to get the same food as WT. Plane left on time and arrived early. Crew friendly - I had little call to ask them for much, but any request was quickly attended to. Return from Bangkok, incoming flight (and hence departure from BKK) delayed to ATC in UK, BA provided voucher which was more than enough for a good sized breakfast. 777 nowhere near as nice as the A380, noisy, seats less comfortable, and I got barely any sleep on this 13h flight. FAs not as attentive as going out, but no real complaints. Poor choice of entertainment on very small screen. Overall, quite good, and fair value for money in WT+.", "air_title": "British Airways ", "Customer_name": "John Frewen-Lord"}
