What an absolute pleasure that was. Had seat 50H which was at front on top deck. The cabin was nicely laid out, I have to say I like the BA \"cocoons\" I know a lot of people do not but gave me plenty of privacy. The staff were extremely friendly and attentive, with high quality food and excellent champagnes and wines. I would fly this plane again over any other. What was also amazing was a toilet that was not a rabbit hutch. Flew Back on BA056 3 weeks later. Same seat only to find that the seat function did not work, New plane and breaking already! Not a major problem as stewards moved the seat manually for me. The quality of the food and beverages was up to the same high standard as when I flew out. Movie choices were excellent and the quality of the new screens way above those on the older 747's and 777's. I managed to get good sleep on both legs at least 7 hours.", "air_title": "British Airways ", "Customer_name": "Ash David"}
