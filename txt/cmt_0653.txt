Usually exclusively fly with Emirates, but I'm glad I chose Lufthansa this time. Online check in worked like a charm and the bag drop counter was very fast. As the intercontinental flight was red-eye, didn't get to properly check out the IFE, but it looked very promising. Food was excellent, very good taste indeed. Cabin crew were nothing exceptional, but very good nonetheless. Seat on the A340-300 was quite comfortable, and I got some good shut eye. Seats on the A320 BUD-FRA were a bit thin, but can't complain as it's adequate for the short hop. All flights were perfectly on time, and although we had a 1 hour connection in FRA on the return trip, we had plenty of time. Overall, very good first experience on Lufthansa!", "air_title": "Lufthansa ", "Customer_name": "V Kini"}
