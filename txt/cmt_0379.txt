Arrived at Gatwick and was greeted at the check in counter by a friendly member of BA ground staff, our bags were taken and we proceeded toward fast track security, this was effortless and after a few minutes we were in the BA galleries lounge. I find that the BA lounge at Gatwick offers a very poor service early in the morning, all you are likely to get food wise is warm toast, pastries and condiments! The flight boarded on time and priority was given to those flying in the premium cabin, I proceeded onto the plane and was greated by the purser who showed me to my seat and took my coat. After take off the inflight service consisted of a hot English breakfast which was very nice followed by tea/coffee - this is an early flight so no other drink service was offered, however the purser did ask each passenger individually if they would like anything from the bar. Very friendly and attentive crew who addressed each passenger by their name which was a nice touch. The return flight to Heathrow was also very good, the lounge at Alicante is typical of those in Spain, rows of uncomfortable seating with inedible food offerings! Again another uneventful boarding process, the purser on this flight was very attentive and spoke to everyone individually, the meal tasted delicious, chicken curry and rice. All in all BA offer a good Club Europe service, they are trying to cut back and this often shows, they need to consider upgrading their product or risk losing out to the likes of Easyjet or Ryanair.", "air_title": "British Airways ", "Customer_name": "Rob Jones"}
