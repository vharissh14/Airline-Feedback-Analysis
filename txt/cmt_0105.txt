Scheduled departure 23.55, actual departure 05.00, 10/1/2014. Uninformed of delay pre-flight, advanced information would have saved waiting, sitting in an uncomfortable waiting area. Consequent to the delay I missed my Delhi-Lucknow connection, flight 9W2244, 10/1/2014, departure time 09.05. Arrival at the Jet Airways ticket office I was to witness to sheer mayhem, total lack of any organisation. The ticket office manager was oblivious to the mayhem. 13/1/2014, 9W348, Lucknow to Mumbai. This flight was also 2 hours late, again unannounced. 22/1/2014, flight 9W564 Mumbai-Dammam, 19.30, though initially announced as being delayed to 20.45, departed at 21.05. When we were called for departure we did not expect a tour of the airport. On arriving at the aircraft we were kept waiting in the bus. The flight was uncomfortable due to the seating arrangement being primarily for the Asian human body frame, not a Westerners human frame, cramped and uncomfortable to say the least.", "air_title": "Jet Airways ", "Customer_name": "Francis Hands"}
