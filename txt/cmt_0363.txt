Unfortunately the flight back was very different, old tired jumbo plane, poor seating, poor in-flight entertainment and some members of the cabin crew clearly couldn't be bothered and everything seemed to be too much trouble. Plane was far too hot on the way back and despite lots of passenger requests for them to turn the air-con on, nothing seemed to change and it was a long 6hrs. Have flown long haul with Virgin and Cathay Pacific and these were much better on all fronts, would only consider BA in the future if it was the only option available or half the price of the other carriers!", "air_title": "British Airways ", "Customer_name": "D Turner"}
