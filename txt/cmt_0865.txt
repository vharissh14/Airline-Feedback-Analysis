Departed from the \"Z\" section of the terminal, which is a hike. Boarding handled efficiently, though getting everyone to take their seats proved to be a challenge. This is one of the newer 747s and the Y class seats are very good: aside from a decent recline the front of the seat lifts a bit as you lean back, taking pressure off your lower back. Meal and service were good and flight arrived early in HKG.", "air_title": "Lufthansa ", "Customer_name": "J Egan"}
