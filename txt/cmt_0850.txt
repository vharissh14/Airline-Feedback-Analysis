Smooth check-in with an exceptionally polite and efficient agent. The cabin was spotless with soothing colours and perfect temperature. The FA's were very attentive and maintained the professionalism and efficient service I am accustomed to from LH. The seats were the old, angled business class seats which were comfortable in all positions except for sleeping as one tends to slide off the seat. The in-seat USB power did not work on any of the four seats my travel companions and I were seated in. The AVOD selection was limited and inferior to other transatlantic airlines. The meal service was prompt and the food was tasty. There was a wide range of beverage options with a good wine selection. Flight left and arrived on time. Lufthansa offers a good product with dependable service, surprises are rare if any.", "air_title": "Lufthansa ", "Customer_name": "T Eldem"}
