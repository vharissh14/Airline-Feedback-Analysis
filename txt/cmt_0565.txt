It was really excellent on all fronts: friendly and efficient service from check-in to arrival. The food was plentiful and very nice quality: a salad starter with fresh bread and NZ olive oil, a warm meal; dessert, cheese and biscuits, and good NZ wines. Breakfast and afternoon tea were also excellent, with e.g. warm scones, clotted cream and jam. The food was better than BA's Club World. The seat provides lots of space, and the entertainment system is stocked with films I missed at the cinema, so enjoyed catching up with on the plane. The seat doesn't recline that much, but there's a bean bag, a big pillow and a nice, thoughtful amenity kit. There were other fun touches too, like a photo of shelves of books with jokey titles on the walls in the toilet. On the way out, the luggage belts at Heathrow were broken, so most bags did not make it to the plane. Air NZ handled this efficiently on the plane, and with minimal fuss in LA we were handed US$100 in cash. This is my first time with Air NZ, it's such a shame they don't fly to more places from Britain!", "air_title": "Air New Zealand ", "Customer_name": "Richard Ogden"}
