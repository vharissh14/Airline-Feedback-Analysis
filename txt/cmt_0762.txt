It was a really good travel experience for us. Very comfortable and convenient too. Seats are comfortable, same as any other regular Lufthansa flights. Landing at Pune for Puneites is far better than to Mumbai, saving a lot of time in immigration process and travelling from Mumbai to Pune. Its really great to fly direct to Pune from Europe and credit to Lufthansa and PrivatAir.", "air_title": "Lufthansa ", "Customer_name": "Parag Narkhede"}
