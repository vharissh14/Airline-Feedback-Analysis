The seats are very uncomfortable and there is very little room to relax or work if the passenger in front reclines their seat. The new cabin looks very small with the new seats and I would not recommend anyone wanting to work to fly with BA now. The service was not to a good service, and when taxiing you could hear passengers telling someone to turn their phone off but no crew moved to find out what was going on, they were more concerned in their own conversations. I hasten to add that this is the new cabin crew with the thunderbird hats who are far inferior to the well paid counterparts. BA short hall can now be classified as a Low Cost Carrier now, they have lost all sense of customer service & customer needs.", "air_title": "British Airways ", "Customer_name": "Bob Motto"}
