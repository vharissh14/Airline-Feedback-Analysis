The first flight was uneventful. The 2nd flight or return was awful. I think Air NZ has gone downhill. My tray table was direct and had juice marks or sticky stuff on it. There was dirt below the armrest. The row in front of me had chewing gum on the seats. My inflight entertainment did not work at all for the entire flight despite being reset twice. There was no ice on board and ran out apparently - sometime I do not believe that. Overall a lousy airline.", "air_title": "Air New Zealand ", "Customer_name": "Shirley Antonucci"}
