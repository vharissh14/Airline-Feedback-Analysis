Compared to other airlines on the route, Lufthansa is downright boring, but absolutely efficient. The short-haul A320s have zero IFE and only a bare minimum in terms of onboard comfort, but the handling and service is flawless. My 19.30 flight from PRG was delayed, which would have prevented me from making a tight connection in FRA. Instead, baggage drop-off staff already awaited me with a new boarding pass for an earlier flight, which was delayed as well, and rushed me through fast track to comfortably make my connection. LH even serves sandwiches on the 35min hop to Frankfurt. Both Singapore legs were on the A380, which is always a treat. The cabin is extremely basic and the AVoD is just average, but the service is snappy and organized, meals are good, crews are friendly. It's hard to get a good night's sleep in economy, but the overall experience is still as painless as it gets.", "air_title": "Lufthansa ", "Customer_name": "Juraj Kovac"}
