Check in/bag drop at T5 once again very slow, appears to be a staff shortage at some times of the day. My FFS allows me to use the lounge so I had time for a quick coffee, I like the BA lounges at T5. Boarding on time, seat 26A on a A320 seemed new with a nice crew a snack and a drink served. Return check in quick Milan Malpenza Airport is horrible! Managed to find lounge close to B35 limited food but quiet, wifi was poor although there is a smoking lounge. Boarding quick seat 19A and another newish A319, full flight snack and drink served crew very chatty early arrival at T5. Good product although I booked on day of travel so a bit expensive.", "air_title": "British Airways ", "Customer_name": "C Cutts"}
