Both flights more or less on time with excellent crew on both legs, very attentive and cheerful, with plenty of drink runs and quite tasty meals. Entertainment quite good with a huge choice of movies, TV and music,. On arrival into Seatac I was through immigration and customs with my luggage and in my limo in under an hour. On arrival into Heathrow terminal 5 it took about the same amount of time. I've been flying this route for the past twenty five years, on average two to three times a year, and BA is certainly the best airline flying to Seattle.", "air_title": "British Airways ", "Customer_name": "Vivienne Pinnell"}
