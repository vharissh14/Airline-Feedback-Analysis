Already written about the disastrous seat reservation system, so I won't rant on about this here again. I would say though, that it took no fewer than 4 people at Frankfurt to actually resolve our seating issues. In the end only the Flight Manager was able/willing/empowered to deal with it. The crew on all flights were to be fair very good and the food was fine too. Seats however were very uncomfortable on the B747 so I got little if any sleep on the long 11 hour flights. Also, the IFE is terrible. I have a very varied and eclectic taste in TV, music and film and found little to entertain me. And to top it all off, Lufthansa left our bags in Frankfurt en route back to London and can't seem to drag themselves to get them back to us in Southampton until tomorrow, even though by their own admission, they have now arrived on a later flight.
