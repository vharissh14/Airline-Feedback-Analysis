IAD lounge was charming, great bar, nice Concorde dining room with good service, nice food and on my visit an excellent soup. Greeting staff very nice, and bartenders that knew how to do their job. Only the slightest downfall was in the Club Class section of the lounge the finger sandwiches were dry as sand and just as flavorful. Station Manager, Captain, and Inflight Crew were was kind and generous with their time. Food was decent, Champagne was great! IFS was strange and not easy to use but got help from FA's on both flights. Arrival at T5 was shocking. Like a heard of rabid bovine charging for the exits. Shoved like sardines into small trains with nothing to hold onto, everyone started to tumble. Processing through fast track however was a breeze. Return. F check in is at the far end of the terminal, agent at the counter had the personality of wall paper paste. Concorde Room staff were delightful, breakfast was nice, Massage was ok. Train to gate not nearly the terror it was on arrival. Boarding for First was a snap FA's top notch food ok. Arrival into IAD was as joyus as surgery with long walks, confusing machines, little help. Overall after reading so much negative about BA, I was at least made to feel special at every stop except check in at T5.", "air_title": "British Airways ", "Customer_name": "M Thompson"}
