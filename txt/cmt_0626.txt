B767-300 ER. Cabin spotless. Staff were very friendly and talkative. Food was great although I wasn't able choose as one of the options had run out. However, the lemon pepper chicken was tasty anyway. Lots of great entertainment, music and movies were awesome. Didn't get bored the whole flight. Flight left Auckland 20 minutes late and arrived in Tokyo 20 minutes early! A speedy baggage pickup meant I was able to get an early bus to my home town. Saved me about an hour and a half of waiting. Overall a great experience. Highly recommend Air NZ.", "air_title": "Air New Zealand ", "Customer_name": "M Potter"}
