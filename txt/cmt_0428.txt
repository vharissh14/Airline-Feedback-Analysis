A320 out which appeared new - a full flight of around 1.5hrs with a sandwich and drink served. Crew very nice and we arrived slightly early. Return check-in quick and then a long walk to the lounge which was shared with 5 or 6 airlines - OK not much food but pretty quiet and nice place to wait for flight. A319 on return full, again crew very nice the same sandwich and drinks served - arrived back at T5 on time, no bags so out within 20 min.", "air_title": "British Airways ", "Customer_name": "C Cutts"}
