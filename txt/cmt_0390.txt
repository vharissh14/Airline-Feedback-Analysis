No real issues, pleasant crew and flights on time, but Boeing 737-400 in both directions was clearly very old. Rips in seats, badly worn seat pockets, very noisy aircraft particularly on landing, not the most comfortable seats although leg room is good. Would have preferred a choice of food rather than just a wrap, as this is meant to be a premium airline. Not a bad airline for short-haul really but I have had much better experiences this year with Norwegian and EasyJet, both of which I will now choose over BA when possible until they heavily invest into their short-haul fleet.", "air_title": "British Airways ", "Customer_name": "S Flynn"}
