Full-ish flights and friendly enough crews. F&B; were good as far as they went, but service was slow with an apparent reluctance to offer more than 1 drink with the works. Seats were bog standard Y for 320, but it does seem that seats on all airlines in Y get smaller as I get older! As a use of Airpoints this was good value for money.", "air_title": "Air New Zealand ", "Customer_name": "David Husband"}
