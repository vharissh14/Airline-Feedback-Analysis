The check in is like buying a Hamburger, just unfriendly. You can see cost cutting here. The lounge in Sydney is out dated and is in need of urgent renovation. The food service is very basic. Onboard extreme cost cutting has taken effect. Considering the amount paid and the service received, I would say that there a very little features and benefits. Would not travel NZ again, than for the same price I will get much superior service by the opposition.", "air_title": "Air New Zealand ", "Customer_name": "H Kohl"}
