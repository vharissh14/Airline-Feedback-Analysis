We came from Dubai, and had to take the 11.35 flight from Mumbai to Kozhikode on 8 April 2014. The function was at 18:30 the same evening. We approached the check-in counter well in advance at 9:45 and made to wait for about 20 minutes without being told why. We're then told the flight is overbooked and were asked to wait until 11:00. At 11:00 told that we cannot board the flight because it is overbooked. Overbooking flights is understandable. Most airlines do it. However, with Jet Airways, we were given a bad alternative considering our situation, \"compensation\" of INR 3000 and told to take the 13:25 flight to Kochi, and a 5 hour drive to Kozhikode from there. Not the best option for 2 girls who aren't familiar with the city. And guess what, we face the inconvenience, and we pay and arrange for all this. We were told that they would approach passengers to find out if anyone is willing to give up their seats. As it turns out, this was not true, because we had another friend on the same flight who mentioned this situation to passengers who were indeed willing to give up their seats. We were told that we would be assisted by Jet Airways staff at the Kochi airport, with the taxi bookings. Didn't happen. While overbooking flights is normal, the way Jet Airways handled this situation is unacceptable. At the end of it, we had the impression that they did not take us seriously at the Mumbai airport. Very bad service at the Mumbai airport, and non-existent service at Kochi airport. Unless I have absolutely no choice, I would never choose this airline again.", "air_title": "Jet Airways ", "Customer_name": "S Naidu"}
