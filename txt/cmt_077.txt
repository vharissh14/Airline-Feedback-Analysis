Plane was in decent repair and comfortable. Good AVOD. Nice blanket and duvet. Impoverished amenities kit and only offered on 1st leg. FAs were well groomed and attentive. Limited selection but decent champagne/wines. But Jet served the worst food (choosing non veg) I have ever received on an airline. It bordered on inedible. One meal had an empty plate on it! They will not be internationally competitive with this cuisine, especially on the Brussels-Mumbai leg. Buffet in Brussels lounge was primarily Indian cuisine.", "air_title": "Jet Airways ", "Customer_name": "Paula Loguda"}
