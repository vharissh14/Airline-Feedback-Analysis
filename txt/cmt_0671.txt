As often with Lufthansa I found the flights satisfactory but not outstanding. Airplane looked new, the cabin was in good condition and clean (the bathroom less so, at least after a few hours into the flights). Beverages were served several times, selection and quality were good. Food was o.k. but nothing to rave about, except for the very tasty passion fruit cream for dessert on the flight back and the chocolate in between. I am glad, though, that again there was a vegetarian option. Service was quite friendly and attentive. For a tall person, though, the space in Lufthansa's Economy Class is really sub-standard: narrow seats, leg room barely alright if the person in front of you has the seat in an upright position but very uncomfortable if that is not the case. My seat neighbor, who had a center seat, could hardly get out of the row. The space on Avianca's A318 for a domestic flight before that was definitely more generous and did not feel as claustrophobic. The IFE touch- screen did hardly react on both flights. Changing the program was therefore difficult.", "air_title": "Lufthansa ", "Customer_name": "Richard Hattemer"}
