Both legs on lower deck of the A380, professional yet friendly service, plenty of drink runs between meal services. Seat comfort superior to LH and AF380s. Travelled with an elderly passenger, attentive gate staff allowed us to pre-board on both flights. Both flights arrived ahead of schedule. So far best transatlantic experience on an A380.", "air_title": "British Airways ", "Customer_name": "I Kroum"}
