We flew back on January 9, 2015 the same route. Flying 15.5 hours from Toronto to Delhi and back was a torture, primarily due to: 1) Worn out seats with hardly any cushion, 2) no hot water in toilets, 3) filthy floor in toilets, 4) toilet tissue running out on two flights with no one paying attention, 5) poor quality of food, and worst of all, 6) waiting nearly two hours in Toronto upon our return, for the luggage to arrive. More than half of the flight staff was courteous. We took altogether 8 flights with Jet Airways internationally and within India and none departed on time. At least on two International flights the seats were so stuck, trying to get them to recline was a challenge. Although the entertainment selection was pretty good, the headphones given out had gone through hardly any quality control; one of them was dead and another with its cable coming off. During the stop over in Brussels both time, the passengers got out, stood in long queue, simply to go through a security check by extremely rude airport staff, with no time to freshen up, read: washing our face with warm water! It seemed no one controlled the temperature in the planes during flight, at times it got too cold and then too warm. Over all, we decided unanimously, never to fly Jet Airways again.", "air_title": "Jet Airways ", "Customer_name": "J Joseph"}
