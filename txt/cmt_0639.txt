Both flights were perfect. Great thanks to all the crew members for excellent service and comfort. Yesterday on March 25th took the same flights back from BCN to MSQ! The first flight was rather nice but the plane from Frankfurt to Minsk experienced some technical problems and we had to fly back to Germany. But all the staff members both in the airport and on the plane acted very professionally. We got a new plane and landed safely in Minsk.
