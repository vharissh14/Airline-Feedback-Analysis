I checked in at Seattle (flew with United from SEA-SFO) so my baggage was fine. Arrived at SFO to find out that my aircraft was delayed 6 hours, and were never told why. Got on board to have the crew be rude. I had a small child sitting next to me constantly reaching over my tray table and stealing my food from me, neither the father or cabin crew did something even when asked. Once arriving in Auckland I had a transit time of what was now reduced to 5 hours, originally being 12. When returning to the airport, there was a mistake in short-checking my bag, as the system still showed my bag checked through to Melbourne. After having this all happen I then had my carry-on luggage weighed. I had taken items out in AKL. I was then found that my bag was 0.5kg over and that it couldn't travel with me even if it was checked. After a lot of negotiation I was finally allowed to take my bag as carry on. Onboard my trans-tasman flight it was quite pleasant however not as great as other airlines I have experienced. I don't recommend Air NZ to anybody.", "air_title": "Air New Zealand ", "Customer_name": "T McCaw"}
