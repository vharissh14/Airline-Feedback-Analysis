We flew from Auckland to Perth in the excellent new Dreamliner - what a plane! The seats were the best business class seats we have had the pleasure of traveling in so far. The entertainment system was superb, and very easy to use. The food was 5 star restaurant quality and as usual great friendly staff. We were amazed to how great we felt after a 7 hour flight and the hostess said that is because of the cabin pressure in the new Dreamliners, we have had no jet lag and slipped into Perth time straight away. Can't wait for our return flight home!", "air_title": "Air New Zealand ", "Customer_name": "J Feaver"}
