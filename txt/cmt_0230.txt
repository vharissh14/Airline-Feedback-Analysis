Flying out I was in economy, a bit tight but service was very friendly. Only complaint would be that drinks took a long time to be served, in fact by the time they reached the back it was well past an hour into the flight and long after the sandwiches had been handed out. A second drinks or coffee/tea service would have been appreciated. Flew Club Europe on inbound (Jan 7, 13.40 flight) and although I'm not a seasoned business-class traveller, I thought it was impeccable for the modest premium paid. 737 had the old layout, so no complaints about seat comfort, not sure if I'd say the same with the newer seating arrangement from what I've read on this forum. Crew member serving the club cabin could not have been better - everything was served with the most gracious of smiles and the mood in the cabin was relaxed but convivial. Food and drinks very good and appropriate for time of day and length of flight. Miro Lounge in Barcelona top-notch. Will definitely try to book Club in the future.", "air_title": "British Airways ", "Customer_name": "P Herman"}
