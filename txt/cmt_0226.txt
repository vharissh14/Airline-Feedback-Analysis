Great legroom on the E190 and comfortable seats, quick and hassle free boarding. Service was a bit slow but included a drink and a snack (enough for such a short flight of an hour) with the option for more if so desired. Would recommend. LCY is going to be my airport of choice when going to London in future, was sitting on the DLR 15 mins after landing and at my hotel 40 mins after disembarking and the trip on public transport was only \u00a34.80 rather the excessive cost/time from other airports in the area.", "air_title": "British Airways ", "Customer_name": "A Clarke"}
