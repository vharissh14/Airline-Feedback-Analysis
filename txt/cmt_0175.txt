Outbound was rescheduled due to changes requested by my company's business partner in Milan. This was the third reschedule, and BA charged 433.40, 533.90, and 275.00 successively on a basic $1822.00 economy flight. No other airline does this in my experience. Incredibly, my travel agency could not reserve me a window seat ahead of time - unless I paid an extra $53.00 for each flight. I did so, but was given an aisle seat on the outbound flight anyway. Both overseas legs were on 747s that were extremely cramped for someone over 6 ft. tall. On the way out, my antiquated in-flight display did not work. On the way back, my headphone jack was broken. We left Heathrow 90 minutes late due to a computer glitch but for the next 12 hours the BA website indicated on time arrival, so my wife waited two hours extra at SFO. Overall, a very poor experience. I will avoid BA whenever possible.", "air_title": "British Airways ", "Customer_name": "Brad Basler"}
