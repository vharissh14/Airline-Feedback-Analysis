BA have total monopoly on the London/Tampa rout, and don't they know it. I fly this about every six weeks or so, normally in Club World but sometimes in Premium just due to the huge price variance. The quality of the planes on this route, but more importantly the service and staff attitude are way below the standard you would expect, and this trip was no exception. Old plane, miserable arrogant staff and poor service. I pray every time I fly that another carrier will take up a slot at Tampa, as it's a growing airport, and when they do BA will definitely lose my business, and I suspect, many others.", "air_title": "British Airways ", "Customer_name": "Robert Wright"}
