Flight left on time, and arrived in Nadi earlier due to a tail wind. We had a works ticket which meant we got a meal, which I was very impressed with. Never knew airline food could be so good. Flight attendants as always very friendly. My only complaint is the seating of this plane. It is very squashed, and the seats seemed very uncomfortable. I had difficulty eating my meal as I was in the centre seat, and just really had no room for my arms. The seat was so uncomfortable that I had a slight back ache in my lower back. A terrible plane really. Would avoid a A320 in the future if I could.", "air_title": "Air New Zealand ", "Customer_name": "Taylor Sue"}
