It is what business class should be like. Very attentive staff although the food is getting a bit downgraded and staff at the LAX lounge are just okay, I think the majority of staff are now subcontractors so do not have the Kiwi values except for long term staff. Air NZ needs to be careful not to try and squeeze out too much profit, yet is still offers one of the best business classes in the field. Just fly UAL from Sydney and see how they have not really upped their game. I wish they would match AirNZ.", "air_title": "Air New Zealand ", "Customer_name": "F Silvestri"}
