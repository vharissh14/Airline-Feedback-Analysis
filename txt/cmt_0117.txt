Appreciated the assistance at check- in in Kolkata on 11th Dec when our flight from Kolkata-Mumbai was canceled without notice. Staff were very helpful in finding a solution and guided us to IndoAir in order to catch our flight Mumbai-Brussels. On the Mumbai- Brussels flight (seats, 20D/E) the staff was very friendly, helpful and polite.
