The lounge was good overall if a bit crowded and over heated. There was snack type offerings until 6.30pm when hot food was supplied, This was very well cooked and presented, the Thai green curry was excellent, so compliments to the chef. Boarding was on time and efficient unlike our previous BA experience at HKG. We found the middle seats on this plane a bit cramped but comfortable for sleeping. The inflight food was very good, I had a chicken and rice dish, my wife had braised beef which she says was excellent, I do think dessert and cheese should be offered. Unlike our last BA flight 5 weeks ago the crew on this flight were excellent, friendly and attentive. The IFE selection is fair but the screen is square and is small compared to that on the A380 (and very small compared to CX). Thanks to the FA's we had a very enjoyable trip. We would fly BA again but only if the price was very competitive, the staffing inconsistencies worry me some what, this is really a management issue and should be addressed, if it were the BA brand would be more competitive.", "air_title": "British Airways ", "Customer_name": "R Simpson"}
