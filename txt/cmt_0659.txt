I did online-check in 24hrs before, so I only had to go to the bag drop counter. The line was very long so I had to wait a long time. The funny thing was that the check-in line was much faster. Boarding was fast. The impression I got of the crew was that they were very unfriendly and were very stressed. The seats were comfortable for a long flight. Leg space was okay if the front seat isn't reclined. A plus was the inflight entertainment, a large selection of movies, music, TV shows and games. The food was better than average, a choice between two dishes. I had the chicken which was okay for an onboard meal. Breakfast was an omelette with spinach and hash browns, a plus is, that you have a good choice of beverages and alcoholic drinks. All in all it was a nice flight, with average food and stressed stewards. In the past service was much better.", "air_title": "Lufthansa ", "Customer_name": "S Buchholz"}
