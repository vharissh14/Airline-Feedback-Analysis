I was upgraded to Business and it was a real treat. All in all the flight was very good. Lots of legroom, flat bed to rest, wonderful service and good food. If I could change anything: better trays (for food) - this is the only element that I don't think is very comfortable but this isn't a reason to score lower. The LH team was excellent, as usual on the flight(s) and it was a wonderful end to being in Europe by having gotten the upgrade into business.", "air_title": "Lufthansa ", "Customer_name": "K Sutch"}
