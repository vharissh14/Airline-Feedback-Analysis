Great staff service that ensured my wife and I plus luggage were on this flight in spite of a non-through ticket and just 50 minutes of transit time. The flight itself was much less pleasant - cramped seats, not enough foot room in front of seat, and an entertainment system that leaves much to be desired.", "air_title": "Lufthansa ", "Customer_name": "G Baldacchino"}
