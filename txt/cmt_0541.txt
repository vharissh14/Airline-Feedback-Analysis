On both flights the food was average and only two meals, not even a snack for Lunch prior to arriving in YVR. The plane was in need of a refit. The entertainment (systems) both choice and operation was rubbish, system crashed, jumped and skipped so I gave up. Second major item was the Gate staff at YVR. 4 of them and two only checked in the gold/priority customers, leaving the other two to check in 300+ others. All in all not impressed.", "air_title": "Air New Zealand ", "Customer_name": "B Hoy"}
