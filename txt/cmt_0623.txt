On the outward flight I was lucky enough to be upgraded to a better seat by the LHR lady who checked me in and was happy with everything. Don't expect to be super comfy in economy but this 'preferred seat' was great. On the return flight on checking in at Christchurch for the hop to Auckland (NZ 546, 7/1/14, boarding 19.15) I asked the check in attendant if there was any chance of a better seat (mine was 55F one seat in from the aisle in the central row where I had not enough room to pick up something I had dropped on the floor). I was told in no uncertain terms that \"I was lucky to have a seat as this flight is overbooked\"! I was pretty annoyed. As I had 24hrs flying ahead of me I decided to remain calm and not react. Fortunately at LA (what a dive that is) I asked tentatively if there was any chance of a change of seat and the attendant was able to offer me a window seat 49A which was so much more comfortable, I had room to move for which I was most grateful. Apart from the lady at Christchurch I have nothing but praise for the staff both ground and air.", "air_title": "Air New Zealand ", "Customer_name": "Sue Day"}
