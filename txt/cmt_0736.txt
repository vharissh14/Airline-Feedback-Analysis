Convenient schedules, good and efficient service almost throughout. It was worth the premium over flying with another company. The boarding at Munich was the only thing that could have been better - the flight was delayed by about 30 minutes and boarding was somewhat chaotic. Definitely looking forward to my next Lufthansa flights.", "air_title": "Lufthansa ", "Customer_name": "B Borg"}
