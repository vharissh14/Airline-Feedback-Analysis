This could not be considered even remotely close to what business class travel should be. Check your own bags in, late departure with no reason given, shoddy lounge, poor food and beverage choice with disinterested slow cabin staff. The plane itself is worn out too. I would definitely not be encouraging anyone to pay to fly air NZ business class. Might be just worth the cost of an economy ticket.", "air_title": "Air New Zealand ", "Customer_name": "P List"}
