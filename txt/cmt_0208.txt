Flight crew excellent as always. Food was pretty decent for airplane food. Seat was comfortable and certainly better than sitting in the back of the plane. However, we think this configuration is a failed experiment by BA. Eight seats across is too many for Business Class. The seats were too narrow. The backward facing seats are disconcerting for two reasons: If you are traveling with a spouse or friend, and neither likes to face backwards, you can't sit together. Secondly, when the divider is down, you stare at a stranger 15 inches away. Hope BA reverts to the old style one day.", "air_title": "British Airways ", "Customer_name": "J Gerwin"}
