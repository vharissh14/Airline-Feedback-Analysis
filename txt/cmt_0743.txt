It was a old 747 flight, the IFE screen was very small and useless, no touch screen. There was no great selection of movies unless you know German. I wish I carried iPad. The FA's were rude, not interested in customer service. For the 10 hour flight from Chennai to Frankfurt, first 8 hours they serve nothing other then two rounds of juice. Just before landing a small light breakfast. Seats were cramped. I was disappointed with LH and will not fly again.", "air_title": "Lufthansa ", "Customer_name": "Siva Krish"}
