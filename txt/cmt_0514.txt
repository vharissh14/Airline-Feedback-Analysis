I booked Air New Zealand as a result of the good price I got (\u00a3518 return), but the experience was such that I would definitely use them on this route instead of Virgin or BA. The food and wine selection was better than most airline food I have eaten except, perhaps, Turkish Airlines. The aircraft on the outward journey was only 2 weeks old and immaculate. The returning flight was in Lord of the Rings Livery and was also a pretty new aircraft. Upon first glance the seats seem quite narrow, but sometimes looks deceive and I found the seating very comfortable. I accept that I had no seat in front of me, but my daughter, who had a seat in front of her, was pretty comfortable despite being quite tall. The only negative with the Boeing 777-300 in this layout is the very narrow aisle, but it's not a deal breaker for me. However, the best thing about Air New Zealand were the staff, friendly, helpful and professional on both legs of the flight.", "air_title": "Air New Zealand ", "Customer_name": "M Lyall"}
