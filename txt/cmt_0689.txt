Early morning flight was on time, Crew were nice and offered chocolate cookies before take off. Flight only 50 minutes, but got a nice coffee with milk and one juice. Captain informed about flight details. In Munich gate was with jetfinger and since the plane was not full, it just took a few minutes to deplane. Love LH over Germanwings, too bad they do not fly from Cologne to Hamburg.", "air_title": "Lufthansa ", "Customer_name": "H Mutschler"}
