Seat was fine, helped by the fact that seat next to me was unoccupied. Service from staff was very good, friendly and efficient. You don't appear to get bubbly/juice before departure anymore and the choice of wines was same as in economy. Meals were good and tasty. Massive choice of movies.", "air_title": "Air New Zealand ", "Customer_name": "Siebers Robert"}
