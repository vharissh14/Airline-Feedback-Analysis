In BRU check in, passport control (very long queues), security fast track and lounge just fine but nothing very special. Security in T5 with extra long queues and very little fast track. Almost none. Lounge in T5 a bliss in all respects. Boarding ok although gate in T5b miles away. Flight itself a disaster, old tatty B747 in need of an urgent revamp. Very used and ran down seats. Cabin full, so crew, although quite experienced, busy, food options were gone fast and service not that great as in the past. Ran out of champagne. Food not good at all. Inflight entertainment and videos a bore, with very old titles. Bags not first out. Return again same experience, although a 777, good check in and security fast track - lounge ok with option to dine before flying which I took, in case food was same disaster as flight in. Not full cabin this time, so a little better service although quality is still zero. Again London T5 lounge a breeze and fast and short flight to BRU.", "air_title": "British Airways ", "Customer_name": "E Simeone"}
