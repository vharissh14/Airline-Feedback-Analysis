Alternative flight arrangements were horrendous. What should have been a 26 hour trip between UK and NZ turned into 45 hours. During that 45 hours not a single member of Air NZ staff came and explained what was going on. No gluten free meals had been arranged for my husband who has Coeliac Disease and the final straw was being routed via Brisbane and practically abandoned! No onward booking had been made for us. We have flown regularly between UK and Australia and NZ for the last 15 years and this was the worst customer service we have ever come across!", "air_title": "Air New Zealand ", "Customer_name": "Fletcher Ann"}
