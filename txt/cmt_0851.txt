The food is great, you'd always want another plate, even in Economy. The service and the crews are always friendly and willing to fulfil every need. They did come through the cabin every 20 minutes offering a selection of drinks from a tablet to not disturb the passengers sleeping. Onboard, even in Economy, nearly every drink is included and so you'll never regret choosing Lufthansa! The only drawback is the inflight entertainment system installed on the A380's and 747-8's, the new RAVE system they refit onto the A330/A340 fleet is great, but sadly it isn't available upon delivery of the aircraft as manufacturers don't install this system. But though the selection of movies in different languages is great, the only bad thing about the system on A380 and 747-8 is the screens are responding extremely slow and they are quite small, due to a lot plastic surroundings. And the flight information is insufficient, as the system doesn't show altitude, speed (ground and air), flight heading, wind speed and direction and such stuff. Overall great flights, with just this minor drawback.", "air_title": "Lufthansa ", "Customer_name": "M Kramer"}
