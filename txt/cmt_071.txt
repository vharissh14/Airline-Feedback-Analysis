Good food but the flight from Chennai to Singapore was nothing short of appalling in terms of aircraft condition. I was in Seat 2A and the edge of side of the seat was broken and patched with industrial tape! When the passenger pushed his seat to a recline position (and these are not flat beds) he knocked back my food tray and my video. It also made coming out of my seat to visit the toilet very tough. Such a good airline, flying international and its business class seats are rubbish and patched with tape!", "air_title": "Jet Airways ", "Customer_name": "K Dilip"}
