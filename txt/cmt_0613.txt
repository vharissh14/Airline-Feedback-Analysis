In Wellington I was kindly assisted by someone from Air NZ . Also for my return flight home the self-check-in was aborted and had to go to the kiosk in Auckland. For my last trip from Auckland (NZ) to Dusseldorf (D) there I could only get a boarding pass for just the flight from Auckland to Sydney. For the other boarding passes I had to find my way in Sydney to get the next boarding passes. Very inconvenient and stressful, especially when one needs an aisle seat because of physical handicap. Finally has it been handled well by the staff of Etihad.", "air_title": "Air New Zealand ", "Customer_name": "Gerkema Edo"}
