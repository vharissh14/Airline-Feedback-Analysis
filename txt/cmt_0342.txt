The crew, food and inflight entertainment were good. We travelled economy and paid an extra \u00a3140 to reserve 2 seats on the upper deck. We found the seats uncomfortable and when the person in front reclined their seat you were trapped. Leg room was restricted by the video box. We were sat 2 rows from the toilet which were nearly constantly in use and the noise from the toilet flush was an irritating. The inflight entertainment just kept me sane as I found it impossible to be comfortable.", "air_title": "British Airways ", "Customer_name": "Gordon Wheeler"}
