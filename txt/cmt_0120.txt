Pretty surprised of the high standards and professionalism of Jet Airways. Food was very tasteful, well presented and plenty. On top of that we were served by an extremely friendly crew. Return flight DEL-BRU the 1st December was completely the opposite though. Before takeoff menus were distributed and you had to give your choice. I hardly had the chance to look at the menu when the rude stewardess said I had to make my choice. Once my choice made she grabbed the menu out of my hands and took it back. Food was the most terrible I ever had on a flight. The refreshment was tiny and extremely spicy and was served as good as cold. Breakfast even was worse with a few slices of tasteless unripe fruit smashed on a plate followed by a cold omelette and 2 hard cold greasy discs that were expected to be hash brown potatoes! Just as with the refreshment served earlier presentation was inexistent and looked like everything was just smashed on the plate. I told the stewardess this was the worst meal I ever had on a plane. She apologized and offered me cereals instead, this was business class! The only positive point were the flat bed seats.", "air_title": "Jet Airways ", "Customer_name": "Meulders Stefaan"}
