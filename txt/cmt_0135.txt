First only half full on both legs as Club not oversold. Very much better service than when full as crew have time to interact. BA really should consider cutting back the number of seats and sell a truly premium product like so many others have now chosen to do. Food disappointing as usual - much room for improvement here. Decent wines, but whites/champagne always warm on the return as kept unchilled during the turnaround. T5 experience fine both ways as mid-week and time of year not so busy. Lounges good and lounge staff friendly both LHR and PHL.", "air_title": "British Airways ", "Customer_name": "Bill Atkins"}
