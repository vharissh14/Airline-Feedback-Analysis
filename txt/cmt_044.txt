Staff is friendly and helpful, and seem pleased to be of assistance, they are certainly not surly like some airline attendants. It is small touches that makes flights on Jet Airways satisfying. Hand lotions in the economy class bathrooms, toilets equipped with bidets, an extensive selection of vegetarian menus (oriental, Jain, Hindu, vegan, etc), art-house and hard-to-find movies on the entertainment system. If Jet Airways was part of Star Alliance, it would be one of my first choices.", "air_title": "Jet Airways ", "Customer_name": "Dinesh Parakh"}
