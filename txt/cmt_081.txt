Flight departed Mumbai at lunchtime 1pm, however lunch was served 2 hours later, by which time everyone is starving and hungry. 1 hour into the flight, 1 drink and packet of peanuts. Lunch was ok, though portion size was very small. During the flight, there were 3 rounds of drinks, 1 serving per round, rest of the time, the air hostesses were never around. The final meal was a measly croissant as the main dish. Still not enough for an average human. All in all, a starving flight and I arrived hungry. Inflight system was mediocre, and leg room is just adequate. In case you want to have a comfortable flight, Jet airways is not the flight, its definitely not going to be mine.", "air_title": "Jet Airways ", "Customer_name": "A Madeira"}
