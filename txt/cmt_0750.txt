Lounge in MAN is ok - typical regional airport lounge. Warm croissants. Breakfast on flight was ok - had ordered Asian veg. Service good. The long haul was a pleasant surprise. I'm 6ft tall and managed to get zero sleep on a flight to Mumbai from Frankfurt 7 years ago and that was my last flight with LH. The new Business class was a pleasant surprise. Cabin crew were friendly and welcoming. Amenity kit is good. The seats are a huge improvement on the sloping beds. I managed to get a few hours sleep too. If you sit by the window, you may find it a bit cramped. I switched to an aisle on the way back and this wasn't so cramped. Will use them again for Delhi, especially s the flights tend to get in earlier than most other carriers. Lufthansa served 2 full meals on this flight, which is impressive. Lufthansa need to realise that paneer (Indian Cheese) covered in Indian gravy for both meals wont escape the attention of the least sober passenger. As I wasn't interested in the food, I forgive them. Will fly LH again for value and comfort.", "air_title": "Lufthansa ", "Customer_name": "Patel Niri"}
