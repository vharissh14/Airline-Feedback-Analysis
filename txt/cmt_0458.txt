September 29, 2014. I've been a loyal BA passenger for years but after three recent flights, that's not going to be the case any more. How BA have the audacity to screen 'BA, A Very British Airline' on their IFE is beyond me! While the film chronicles the supposed high standards and rigorous staff selection and training, the reality is altogether different. The food on BA85, LHR to YVR was atrocious - dried chicken sitting in a dubious brown 'sauce'. The service was unsmiling, unhelpful and inattentive. BA used to have a good IFE selection. Not anymore! Very unimaginative selection of films, TV and audio programs. I've recently travelled on Qantas and Air Canada on long haul and both carriers far superior to BA. Air Canada has significantly improved it's standards.", "air_title": "British Airways ", "Customer_name": "Christopher Neep"}
