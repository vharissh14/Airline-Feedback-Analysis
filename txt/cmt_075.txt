Plane was on time, facilities were ok, staff were hard to find outside service times. The absolute worst thing about the experience were the other passengers. They all seemed to be high-maintenance passengers: really elderly people and many bawling and screaming infants. The children did not stop screaming all the way to and from Brussels. I would have expected this on a low cost charter airline, but this took me by surprise. Of course the staff did little or nothing to help keep things calm, you just had to grin and bear it or spend the $500 for an upgrade to Premiere class.", "air_title": "Jet Airways ", "Customer_name": "A Rochard"}
