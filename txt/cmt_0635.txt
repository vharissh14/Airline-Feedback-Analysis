The Spaceseat looks impressive, but was disappointed to find it quite grubby, wet wipes to the rescue, sealed travel blanket covered in food bits, quickly replaced by staff. I loved the seat quite comfortable, taller traveling companion found it very restrictive to finding a comfortable sleeping position. Cabin full but quiet, nice staff, all helpful. Food was very disappointing, fish was just warm, not heated properly, salad had died many days ago. Dessert served before dinner, economy style food with a bit of extra garnish. No tea or coffee after dinner, wine service was just a drinks trolley as per economy. Aside from the food, all in all more pleasant than economy, but IMO lacked the finesse and polish many other premium services offer.", "air_title": "Air New Zealand ", "Customer_name": "Diane Bull"}
