Paid extra for the paired seats which Air New Zealand sells as 'Preferred' seats. Sat in 35a through to Auckland which was alright. Good to be towards the front of the plane for disembarking but the seats are quite narrow and cramped. Sat in 57k onto LA which was slightly better. Missed out on preferred meal but only because I was right down the end. Food was the best I've had in a long time. Entertainment was great and the ability to order drinks from your screen is very handy. It also means no bells going off through the flight for service. Flight attendants were pretty average. Not great but not rude. I drank a lot of Sauvignon Blanc which was delicious and from New Zealand. All in all or was an average flight. Don't know how I would have felt in the middle section of 4 seats. It clearly isn't comfortable for such a long flight so I don't understand why more airlines are installing this seating pattern.", "air_title": "Air New Zealand ", "Customer_name": "L Sean"}
