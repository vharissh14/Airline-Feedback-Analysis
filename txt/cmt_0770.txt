My flight experience from YUL to MUC left me with a bit of mixed feelings. Even though the flight is not that long approx. 7 hrs the plane was fully packed with people and the seats were really uncomfortable. It was not possible to move around and not even sleep. Furthermore, the passenger in front of me considered her right to keep her seat not in the fully upright position during the entire flight leaving me with very limited space. And when I asked the flight attendants to tell her to bring her seat a bit further up so as to have some space myself I was taken by surprise to hear that they could not wake her up and that I should simply do the same or change seat (I seat that I had pre-selected and paid). Maybe Lufthansa needs to reconsider the number of passengers and luggage allowed for long- haul flights and not treat passengers as commodities to that respect.", "air_title": "Lufthansa ", "Customer_name": "Dimitrios Salampasis"}
