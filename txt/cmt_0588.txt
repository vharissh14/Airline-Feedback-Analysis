Our economy seats were cramped, indeed claustrophobic as the passengers in front insisted on having their seats fully reclined for the majority of both legs of the journey to Auckland, effectively preventing use of the inflight entertainment system. The cabin temperature was very cool and we were advised by staff that this was ongoing problem with this particular aircraft. The food quality was at best average, comparable to budget airlines servicing Europe. That said the selection of wines offered is very good. The first leg of the return journey was made more bearable by purchasing a Skycouch option, but should one have to do this on an ultra long distance flight? Reluctantly we will have to consider other carriers for our next trip.", "air_title": "Air New Zealand ", "Customer_name": "P Campbell"}
