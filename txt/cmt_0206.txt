Very old 747 with old style interior in economy. A real disappointment after a series of long haul flights in the new cabin. This really needs replaced. Anyone who has not flown with BA before would leave with a terrible impression. Seats worn, cramped and many falling apart, with outdated IFE. Food and drinks service usual good standard though. Please BA, get rid of this old interior once and for all. It really lets your airline down and does nothing for the passenger experience.", "air_title": "British Airways ", "Customer_name": "Daniel MacDonald"}
