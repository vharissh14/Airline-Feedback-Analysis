Outbound was really good. Cabin Crew very friendly. Always had a smile on their face. Service was very good. They served a cold breakfast which was very good. The way back to FRA was more or less OK. Was not that friendly. What annoyed me was, that there were 3 flight attendants as \"Business Class Passengers\" seated. Not my thing at all, that staff flies business class and chit chat all the way loudly. Sorry folks of LH, but keep things a bit down, especially when you have paying business class passengers on flights. Seat them either in the back close to the galley or on a jump seat when the flight is full. I recommend this airline because the way to BRE they did go the extra mile.", "air_title": "Lufthansa ", "Customer_name": "R Thut"}
