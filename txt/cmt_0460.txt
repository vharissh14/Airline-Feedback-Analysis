Good smooth uneventful trip. Good lounge at Terminal 5. Food and service onboard was very good. Priority boarding and priority pass for immigration in Turkey. However, it is difficult to categorise the seating and space with Business Class. In fact the amount of room available seemed little different to Economy.", "air_title": "British Airways ", "Customer_name": "Mark Niall"}
