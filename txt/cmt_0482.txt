Entertainment very good and staff between Auckland and LA were brilliant, they could not do enough for you and were always making sure you had everything you needed, I wish I could say the same for those between LA and Heathrow who were absent from the cabin for a large amount of the time and did not have any real interface with the passengers. I ordered a coffee in the early hours and this was delivered promptly but I still had the cup over 2 hours later as the staff were absent from the cabin, not very good service. Those staff on the Heathrow leg could learn a lot from those on the Auckland leg.", "air_title": "Air New Zealand ", "Customer_name": "M Rogers"}
