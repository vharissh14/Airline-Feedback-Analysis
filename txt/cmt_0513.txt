A disappointing Business Class experience. Whilst the cabin and seats were nice, the staff attitude was poor - surly, and pretentious attitude that revolves around them rather than the passenger. Distasteful bragging about wining various airline awards - but with little evidence of such justification. Offered champagne at 09.30 in the morning was inappropriate, followed by food that was inedible. All in all, poor value for money, in comparison to other airlines that offer a far superior, attentive service.", "air_title": "Air New Zealand ", "Customer_name": "M Carr-Gomm"}
