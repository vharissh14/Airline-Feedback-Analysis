The cabin crew were rude - I requested an additional pillow - not available apparently! 2 of the toilets on the flight were out of order but I saw cabin crew using it! Food quantity was pathetic - we had pre-ordered hindu non veg meal - told it was not available, when mentioned we had pre-ordered they finally turned up with it. The quality of children's meal was awful. Jet Airways cabin crew made the whole journey unpleasant!", "air_title": "Jet Airways ", "Customer_name": "M Pai"}
