As we are tall thought seat pitch would be same as home. Wrong. Dreadful flight in extremely cramped cabin, my husband was virtually trapped by the seat in front and the only saving grace was that we had a spare seat in between us otherwise I think we would have been standing most of the way. Poor service and truly awful food, if you could call it food. Wrap and small roll with nice chocolate dessert. Wrap was soggy and inedible, roll dry and hardly had any filling. Only one round of drinks, then tea etc with food on a flight of4.5 hours. Really smelly toilets and air conditioning poor. Aircraft old and just a bad flight experience. Took off late too! Have travelled in considerably better flights with charter airlines and following this experience WILL NOT be patronising BA again in economy once we have suffered the return flight! Have gone business class which is good but economy is dreadful.", "air_title": "British Airways ", "Customer_name": "Deb Woolley"}
