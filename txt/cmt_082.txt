For the money it would have cost had I been paying, it seemed pretty fair (it's pretty cheap versus other carriers). Got the red carpet treatment off my incoming Jet domestic flight as I was met by Jet ground staff and ushered into my own car for the journey to the International terminal, whilst the latter is a huge improvement on its predecessor, the way transfers work between the two terminals remains a bit barmy, borne out by the fact that my car took the public roads! The First Class lounge is pleasant enough, but generally continues the Indian tradition of largely mediocre airport lounges. On board, the \"hardware\" is pretty impressive - flat beds, enclosed suites and the like, although I didn't find the seat/bed as comfortable as I would have hoped given its generous proportions. Food remains a bit of a weak point, dinner seemed to be the same as you got in Business. Staff friendly but didn't leave much of an impression to be honest. Entertainment pretty decent.", "air_title": "Jet Airways ", "Customer_name": "M Cowan"}
