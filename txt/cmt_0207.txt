Business Class travel is a rare treat for us, and I can't understand why BA persevere with this unique forwards/backwards facing seating layout. To sit for 11 hours face to face with a stranger is awful, as is the lack of space created by the curved partition between the seats. The cabin crew were great, food was below average, and the inflight entertainment system abysmal: poor choice and terrible picture quality. Outbound we were upstairs on a 747, there were two attendants assisting only 16 passengers, and they did a good job and kept the two toilets clean. Given these circumstances, this flight experience should have been fantastic. However, given the negatives detailed above, I would classify it as just about average. We returned on a 777, and my negative feelings are sadly the same, other than we were stuck on the plane for 40 mins on landing awaiting buses to disembark.", "air_title": "British Airways ", "Customer_name": "P Ellis"}
