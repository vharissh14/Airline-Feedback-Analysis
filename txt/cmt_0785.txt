Truly First Class experience all the way, from the exclusive feel of the FCT at Frankfurt, limo to the plane and then a very warm and professional welcome from the fantastic crew. Cabin 7/8 full. Seats 1A and 1K are great for people traveling together although not the most private. Beautifully elegant cabin, comfortable seat/bed and simply wonderful service. Only the food was disappointing - nothing special and poorly presented. Excellent wines. Bags first off at JFK and off the plane and through Customs within 20 minutes! Would definitely fly again.", "air_title": "Lufthansa ", "Customer_name": "J Braun"}
