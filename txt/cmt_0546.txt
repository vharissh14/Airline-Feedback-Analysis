Once in Christchurch Air New Zealand staff were excellent, they arranged and paid for accommodation, the shuttle to get to the hotel and breakfast the following morning. They then notified us at our hotels about our flight that had been arranged the following day and then collected us all by shuttle to get us back to the airport on time. We had a smooth flight into Queenstown the following day. The situation was handled extremely well.", "air_title": "Air New Zealand ", "Customer_name": "K Lee"}
