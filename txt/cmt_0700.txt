The feeding flight to Frankfurt was uneventful, the small snack was okay, I also like that you can have a beer on shorthaul flights. The walk to the departure gate was very long, but that's not the fault of LH. Flight left Frankfurt on time but arrived late due to the very long flight time of 14 hours (resulting from bad weather over the Atlantic Ocean). Food was okay but less in quantity. I frankly do not understand why airlines cut costs by reducing the amount (and the quality) of food. At least you get alcoholic beverages. Entertainment is now great with a lot of movies/shows to select. I could also find some rest during this 14 hours flight. Unfortunately, flight attendants did not make their rounds with beverages that often. Breakfast was very poor! Lufthansa is a reliable and professional airline, they usually get you to your destination on time. But I am not really thrilled flying them.", "air_title": "Lufthansa ", "Customer_name": "M Schnaufer"}
