This year, I have been very disappointed. Dirty toilets with non-functional soap-dispensers, toasted sandwich snack served cold! Delay in clearing trays to entrap one down, seemingly forever, poor announcements in the airport lounge area, apathetic cabin crew, unilaterally working headphones and the last-straw - allocated seats being occupied by \"upgraded\" economy class customers. Poor show all around!", "air_title": "Jet Airways ", "Customer_name": "Sheela Shah"}
