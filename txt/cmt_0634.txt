Business Premier. Smart 777-300 felt roomy and the interior modern. It was a short 3 hour flight through to Nadi which I was looking forward too after 2 weeks in NZ. The Lounge was Ok and well serviced but very busy. The Qantas Lounge is a letter better and comfortable. Boarding was smooth and the crew welcomed us by name, which is a great touch. Service was professional, friendly and somewhat quick to the point of being a little hurried. The NZ wines and meal was excellent. The seat is great especially when I managed to get a 60 min nap in prior to landing. You can't beat the privacy but it comes at a cost of being social when traveling with a partner. I am not sure if this would be my first choice from LAX-AKL as a re-branded south pacific airline was better in the all round. Air NZ is still a great airline product though!", "air_title": "Air New Zealand ", "Customer_name": "S Adlama"}
