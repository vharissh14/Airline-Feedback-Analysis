On time flight and friendly crews. New seat was comfortable however, if you have a window seat, you need to stride over an aisle seat passenger on the relax/sleeping position. Meals were quite simple, no good nor bad. No impression, and just snacks, sandwiches were served between meal times. BOSE noise cancelling headphone worked quite good. New Entertainment system for 747-8 was excellent. USB port didn't work. AC power outlet worked.", "air_title": "Lufthansa ", "Customer_name": "D Ito"}
