Boarding on time as was departure and arrival, new business seats on both aircraft which were comfortable enough. Food (Breakfast) and crew on outbound very good, bags waiting once through immigration in Sofia. Return check in quick although security check was so slow, the lounge in Sofia is dreadfully dull with no facilities food or drinks, passengers would be better of using the general airport facilities! Departure was almost an hour late as was arrival due to weather at Heathrow; otherwise crew were great as was the lunch served.", "air_title": "British Airways ", "Customer_name": "C Cutts"}
