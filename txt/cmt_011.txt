The worst flight experience we have had in many years and I was literally speechless. My wife and I was traveling with our 6 month old baby and upon boarding the aircraft in DEL we were miserably greeted by the not so interested jet airways air stewards and were not even looked at when trying to settle into our seats. There was no space in the overheads and the crew could see we were struggling but none of them lent a helping hand - totally unacceptable in any class of travel. The seats in business class are awful and something from 20 years ago with virtually zero recline. Food was served in large portions and was just ok. The aircraft is small (737) and there are only 12 business class seats in the formation of 2-2. Just a very awful experience all the way through and we tried to call to get a refund for out return but this was not possible. Avoid this airline and go with Thai, or even Air India if travelling this route.", "air_title": "Jet Airways ", "Customer_name": "J Nanda"}
