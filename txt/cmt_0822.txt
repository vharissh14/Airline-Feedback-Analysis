Two of these were long haul - EWR-DUS on August 3rd and MUC-EWR on August 26th, the other four were intra european - DUS-VIE on August 4th, LWO-MUC-DUS on August 16th and LWO-MUC on August 26th. All of the above flights were on time, pro active and kind cabin staff and ground staff. Meals and drink service were great, cabin crew always ready to offer refreshments and drinks on long haul flights. Hot towels served on long haul flight were much appreciated. Seat comfortable on all flights except one from MUC to EWR where LH Airbus 340-600 still had old economy class seats. Will certainly recommend Lufthansa!", "air_title": "Lufthansa ", "Customer_name": "Ivan Dzhur"}
