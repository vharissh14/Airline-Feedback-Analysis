The food was good, the seats decent. I was surprised and impressed that we were given little packs with toothpicks, toothpaste, etc, and there were numerous new movies to watch. This trip, from New Zealand to LA was quite different. The chicken was grisly and tough, actually inedible, there was no little pack to charm us, and the seats were tighter. I'm a slim person and felt claustrophobic. I'm looking for a different airline for my next flights from New Zealand. I'd rather pay a little more and enjoy the long flight.", "air_title": "Air New Zealand ", "Customer_name": "Kathleen Stark"}
