Everything worked as expected. The flight was on time both for departure and landing. Check-in, security, boarding as well as disembarkation and baggage retrieval worked without a hitch. On-board service was competent and caring. No complaints at all, for Economy Class you can't do much better than that. LH seats seems to be bigger than in the past, a little bit harder but more spacious in length. The inflight entertainment is excellent with touch screen 8' monitor, quite good quality. The only complain is that it shows the program of December 2014 even we started the trip on the first 2015. The steward promised to check and answer but he never returned.", "air_title": "Lufthansa ", "Customer_name": "Hoang Van Hiep"}
