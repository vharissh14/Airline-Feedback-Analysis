Seat only, flight good on time good crew IFE fine but no laptop power and buy on board food is poor. I usually fly QF but their plane was full, and this was the best bet, but it wasn't cheap. While unbundling is sensible the inability to get a decent meal is not. The only way to get a meal is to buy the Works which is not economic for a hand luggage only or day trip passenger. Air NZ is not an LCC so shouldn't act like one. It can do better.", "air_title": "Air New Zealand ", "Customer_name": "L Harvey"}
