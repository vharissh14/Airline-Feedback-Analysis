Being an old 767 seats were comfortable enough, but nothing to write home about. Generally overall disappointing, and have had better seats, food and service in Y+ on 773. There was no amenity pack supplied, and I had to ask for a toothbrush. That said, staff themselves were friendly enough, if not overtly taking the initiative with food and drinks!", "air_title": "Air New Zealand ", "Customer_name": "David Husband"}
