Flight out good, modern plane, clean, food ok and cabin crew good even pleasant. Return 3.11.14 1625hrs from Berlin, horrid. Crew only interested in themselves. Was tossed a cup of coffee and a snack. Staff openly ate the left over food from Business Class in the rear galley. I have complained about this before but clearly BA dont find it unpleasant. The return crew reminded me why I try to avoid BA.", "air_title": "British Airways ", "Customer_name": "A Fitter"}
