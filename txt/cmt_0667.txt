In general, I am happy with Lufthansa service, compared to United Flights I flew earlier. However I noticed a significant difference in service for the flight leg from Mumbai (BOM) to Frankfurt (FRA) LH757 compared to Frankfurt (FRA) to Newark (EWR) LH402. On LH757, flight attendants were not very friendly, one of them was complaining that he had a tough night! As far as I am concerned, most of the passengers were ready to go to sleep as the flight was scheduled at 3am. So there was not much to do for the flight attendants. I would say it was very \"light\" duty for the flight attendants. In Economy class, during the food service, water was only dispensed once. Coffee was never served. When asked for water after dinner, it never was delivered! Now, notice that on this flight alcoholic drinks were not even offered! Most of the flight time flight attendants were not seen. On the leg from Frankfurt to Newark LH402, flight attendants were extra friendly, offering passengers help in finding places for luggage. Offered alcoholic beverages. Extra non alcoholic drinks. After the main dinner service, there were extra offering of beverages like tea, coffee and water! It seemed like a totally different airline! Why the difference Lufthansa?", "air_title": "Lufthansa ", "Customer_name": "Etsy Tahti"}
