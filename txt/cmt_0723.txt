Whenever I fly between Germany and the US I try to fly Lufthansa. Even if one feels that Lufthansa cuts cost it is still better than flying one of the American airlines who typically use old airplanes, don't even offer wine or beer any longer and have terrible food. Lufthansa finally uses upgraded planes between Chicago and Frankfurt which they didn't for quite a while (no idea why). However, the seat comfort (no lumbar support at all) and especially the space between Economy class seats definitely declined or respectively shrunk within the last 7 years. It's a pain to get into these Economy class seats if one is just little bit taller not to mention having a careless passenger upfront of you who rams his seat into your knees without hesitation. The service at Lufthansa is always excellent and I always enjoyed that! Also the food is good and they still offer wine and beer.", "air_title": "Lufthansa ", "Customer_name": "Michael Thumm"}
