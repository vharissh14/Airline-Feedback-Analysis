Very crowded cabins with seats too close on the Airbus 380-800. Seats cannot be reserved ahead, tried every way possible, spent ages on it. Check-in online with actual access to seat map that allows you to chose your seat would make a lot of frequent flyers of all categories much happier. Flight attendants are overwhelmed with issues because of the random automatic system booking. Families are scattered all over the plane. Even after take off there were still people trying to reunite. This mess causes people to try frantically to reserve seats from 3 days before until past the door closures, why in the world does Lufthansa want to have their personal overwhelmed with this problem is a mystery, they lost my trust.", "air_title": "Lufthansa ", "Customer_name": "A Klick"}
