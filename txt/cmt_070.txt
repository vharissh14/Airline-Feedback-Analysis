Flight 9W 0120, Mumbai to London Heathrow on 8th May. After asking staff for an extended seatbelt twice I didn't get one so was without a belt from Baroda to Mumbai. Whilst on board from Mumbai to UK we did not get a proper meal, we had a snack and breakfast! I had my disabled daughter with me. When going from UK to India she had a wheelchair without any trouble it was not the same coming back. I had to keep asking for one. Very disappointed with the service.", "air_title": "Jet Airways ", "Customer_name": "Nilam Ramkrishna"}
