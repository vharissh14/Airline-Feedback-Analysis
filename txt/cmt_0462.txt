Airbus 380 on first leg 747 on second. Both flights completely full. Airbus quiet - on upper deck with a window seat. Room underseat very limited due to two entertainment boxes but storage by window as compensation. For a new plane seat isn't very comfortable - rather hard and I prefer the old-style head rest on the 747s. Great entertainment screen. 747 seat v comfortable and softer but plane is showing its age and noisy after a 380 flight and the seat back screens smaller than many phones these days. Staff on 380 v helpful and pleasant - more functional on the CPT leg. Special meal not provided on last section of CPT leg - otherwise provided and edible. Boarding easy at LAX more chaotic with less waiting area space at Heathrow - they really didn't plan the waiting areas well at Heathrow - just too cramped and poor layout. And transferring through from section c to section a and then back to section b at Heathrow is a real pain and the shuttle was very full too so would avoid if possible. Otherwise flights on time at both destinations despite leaving late. Heathrow is the main drawback when using BA and transferring - what a shame that they didn't make it easier when planning the new terminal. LAX was a joy to use in comparison - so smooth and staff extremely pleasant and helpful despite having a poor reputation.", "air_title": "British Airways ", "Customer_name": "Derek Salter"}
