As a frequent traveller whose budget only stretches to economy class we were very impressed. Very efficient check in and friendly crew, really enjoyed the complimentary snacks and drinks and disagree with other reviews stating \"not enough legroom\" in economy. We all had a very comfortable flight and will definitely fly with Lufthansa again.", "air_title": "Lufthansa ", "Customer_name": "Smedley Jenny"}
