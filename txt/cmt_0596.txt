How could a \"leading, world-class airline\" have a situation where they can't have a pilot or steward on stand-by in case of illness? It was a somewhat chaotic scene at the Raro airport. Lots of passengers waiting for instructions, and not one ANZ staff member for two or more hours! When they finally appeared, the staff were friendly and polite alright, but it took them too long to show up at the airport to help us, and our hotel had already informed us hours earlier that the flight was canceled, so we checked in with ANZ to get the info about what to do, and then checked back in to our old room (a complete waste of an evening), Air New Zealand offered to buy our dinner, at 10pm! We made it home (after missed connections) about two days late.", "air_title": "Air New Zealand ", "Customer_name": "Matthew Todd"}
