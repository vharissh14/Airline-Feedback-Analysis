The take off was scheduled for 1.45 but we were informed that there would be a short delay due to a technical glitch. The delay stretched on and we sat on the tarmac until close to 2.45 with no further information. Some lucky passengers got drinks (many did not) and no food was served. Then we were informed that the technical glitch would take several hours and that we would be deplaned. It took another half hour to get us off the plane and then complete chaos reigned. There were no instructions on what to do next or where to go. There were 2-3 Jet ground staff members surrounded by knots of increasingly angry passengers demanding guidance. The Jet ground staff appeared totally clueless on how to handle the situation. One staff member said we would get new boarding passes (not clear where) while another said that the Delhi based folks should go home and come back at 11 for a 2.15 flight. There were many passengers who were from outside Delhi or who were tourists/visitors who had checked out of their hotels - they were told that hotels would be arranged. There was no protocol, no clear communication - utter chaos. It went on this way all the way to the airport exit - when I left at 5PM, there were still several passengers (including elderly folks) waiting for a coach to take them to a nearby hotel. I have noticed a sharp fall in the service quality at Jet - the staff used to be friendly and competent about 10 years ago but have become brusque, dismissive, and unpleasant besides increasingly incompetent in recent years. Awful experience.", "air_title": "Jet Airways ", "Customer_name": "Vikram Pathania"}
