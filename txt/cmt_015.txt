A group of 5 of us were travelling from Delhi Flights between Heathrow / Deli - Mumbai / Heathrow. Whole 10 hour flight one very small bottle of water offered with a meal. Food Issue - staff passed by without offering drinks. Had to ask for tea / coffee with the meal that was offered. Poor quality service all round.", "air_title": "Jet Airways ", "Customer_name": "J Vaughan"}
