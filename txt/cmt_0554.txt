Firstly, crew are unfriendly and rude. Seats lumpy and very uncomfortable. Plane was dirty - clearly had not been cleaned for weeks, with finger marks smeared across the window, litter from previous flight - sweet wrappers strewn across the floor, fold out tray sticky with dried up coffee spilled. looking down on the floor, clearly not vacuumed for weeks, with gooey grime around the seat fixings. Seat covers peeling off. Was offered a thimble of water, and a stale cookie as food. The overhead screens are so out of focus that you have to strain your eyes to watch it. All of this for premium prices. Basically Air New Zealand operate a low-cost budget operation at sky high prices and compared with the other options I'd say avoid Air New Zealand domestic if you can help it.", "air_title": "Air New Zealand ", "Customer_name": "Matthew Carr-Gomm"}
