It's obvious that a lot of thought has gone into the design of the premium economy seats. There is a lot to like, particularly the legroom, the extra bits of storage space and general layout of the seats. Where they fail is with the reclining system. It allows you to incline your lower body, but what's needed to place people for sleep is a facility to lower your head. In that respect the traditional tilt-back seats were vastly better, despite the problems they can cause for other passengers who don't want to sleep. By airline standards, food and drink were excellent on all four legs. Service too was great, but why can't drinks as well as small pieces of food be left out for pickup between meal services? The entertainment system was OK, but lacking in recent blockbuster movies. I was glad I paid the extra for premium economy, but found it very hard to sleep in these upright pod seats.", "air_title": "Air New Zealand ", "Customer_name": "F Odds"}
