Some of which were affected by their relentless strikes. I found it to be hit or miss, depending on cabin crew. The planes are always clean, but never comfortable. The food is always there, but can be an insult to taste buds. My last flight was cancelled due to them having a pilot strike. Didn't get that message until a day after, which, by then was irrelevant. I went to a Lufthansa counter at Cologne airport to get help. Their helpline was hopelessly backed up. The flight crew on both legs of my trip seemed arrogant and unresponsive. I missed the beverage service, as I was looking out the window - the flight attendant was one row forward by the time I noticed her, and simply ignored my attempts to get her attention. They charge legacy rates for substandard service. I will more than likely shop for other airlines for future trips, making sure it isn't a Lufthansa code share.", "air_title": "Lufthansa ", "Customer_name": "U Salwender"}
