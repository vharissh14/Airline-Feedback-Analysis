Arrival arrangements went well, inter-island travel was challenging because of Air New Zealand's confusing docs re luggage weight allowances. On return day AIT to RAR, ANZ pilot took ill, so we were forced to layover a night in Raro. After waiting over 4 hours at Raro airport for ANZ staff to appear, ANZ proved totally inattentive to our needs, making us wait in the dark, literally, and then they refused to pay for our dinner that night (we ate it too early, 7pm) and staff didn't arrive at airport until 9pm) when we knew well before ANZ staff appeared at the airport that we needed to eat because there would be no \"on-board\" service that evening. A horrible experience, no follow up, save your money and book your own trip/hotels through Fiji.", "air_title": "Air New Zealand ", "Customer_name": "M Bauer"}
