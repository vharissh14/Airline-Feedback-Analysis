Everything worked as expected. The flight was on time both for departure and landing. Check-in, security, boarding as well as disembarkation and baggage retrieval worked without a hitch. On-board service was competent and caring. The C class seat near the window got extra storage on the side and is very convenience. The only problem is the remote control under your arm rest, some times you unintentionally hit the remote control and your film stops. I like the A380 very much.", "air_title": "Lufthansa ", "Customer_name": "Hoang Van Hiep"}
