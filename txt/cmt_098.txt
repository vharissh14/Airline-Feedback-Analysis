On both the sectors I experienced the following: No beverage serving etiquette. I ordered a tomato juice and the airhostess simply dumped a glass without any ice. Ice was offered on request but she did not offer me coaster, salt and pepper, stirrer or a paper napkin. I asked for some Savory Bites with my Juice and she offered me on demand. I immediately called the senior crew member and he responded that, he is helpless as airline is not supplying adequate stock and hence they only provide such basic things on request only. He also indicated that due to inadequate crew on board he is aware of many such lapses. Same serving process I observed with the fellow passengers. Tray table was bent and there was no possibility to keep any beverages or food on the tray. Main food was absolutely awful, fruits and salad were also stale. Most of the crew were unfriendly and tired. Toilets were dirty. Only one type of cheapest hand tissue papers was stacked. Narrow seats and uncomfortable leg room. Audio and Video system was not working.", "air_title": "Jet Airways ", "Customer_name": "Ajmera Aditya"}
