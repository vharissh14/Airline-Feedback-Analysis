We were supposed to be flying on a 777-200, but Air NZ had changed this to a brand new Boeing 787-9 Dreamliner. What a bonus that turned out to be, the aircraft was almost empty, I had a whole three seat row to myself in the rear cabin, and the new aircraft was absolutely brilliant to fly on. The seats are very much the same as the ones on the 777-300, but with a newer entertainment system, and with bigger windows that tint rather than have a shade to pull down. Really enjoyed this flight, look forward to flying on a Dreamliner again soon.", "air_title": "Air New Zealand ", "Customer_name": "G Jones"}
