Cabin constantly too cold. Crew was relaxed and friendly at the beginning but less so at the end. Food a very mixed bag. No sleeping masks or any other give aways. Only upside: Entertainment system of the slightly better version without this clunky old-school remote control but a decent touch screen. On arrival we had a tarmac position (at Munich!) and had to take buses to get to the terminal, something that feels odd on a long-haul flight.", "air_title": "Lufthansa ", "Customer_name": "F Heinemann"}
