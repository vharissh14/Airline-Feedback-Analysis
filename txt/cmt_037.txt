Staff were pleasant food was good, plane toilets clean, in fact we had four very pleasant flights from London to Mumbai, then Mumbai to Sri Lanka and back. Jet was cheaper than the other airlines and proved to be good value for money. All that we want is a pleasant safe journey. I can understand that if you want a choice of food and extra large seats then Jet may not be the airline for you but I would definitely say don't worry about all that you read give them a try and make up your own mind.", "air_title": "Jet Airways ", "Customer_name": "L Whittaker"}
