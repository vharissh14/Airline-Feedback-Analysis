Seat lousy - no legroom, and uncomfortable. Armrest on aisle seat would not lower, making it hard to leave the seat. Staff didn't know how to fix the problem. In-flight entertainment system next to useless because of unresponsive touch screen, and one audio channel not working. Aircraft temperature cold to the point of requiring a jacket be worn at all times. On connecting flight to Berlin Luft. gate staff did not announce gate change in English so confusion resulted among waiting passengers who didn't speak German or missed the change on the electronic screen. Flight from Munich to San Francisco on AB A340 departed late because of baggage handling problem. Aircraft clean, but temperature again cold, and seat comfort worse than A380. In flight entertainment center barely working because of slow, finicky touch screen, and static in audio. Food OK, not good just OK. Before taking Luft. again I will be sure to shop around for a better choice even if it means paying more.", "air_title": "Lufthansa ", "Customer_name": "B Baldi"}
