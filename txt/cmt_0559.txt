The cabin temperature was so hot! I mentioned about the temperature several times to flight attendants. It seemed as if they agreed. I have never been on a flight where the temperature was so hot. The seats were so close together. The girl next to me was practically on my lap and she was leaning on me the whole time. For whatever reason, some of the NZ planes have seats that are too high that my feet don't touch the floor. Yes, I'm short! You would think that seat-proximity wouldn't matter, but it still does. There's nowhere to put my feet except to have them dangle. On a 12 hour flight with my feet dangling, my knees were killing me! There were no footrests or anything. I put my handbag on the floor so I could put my feet up on that, but it was still uncomfortable. I didn't quite understand why the Trans-Tasman flight from Melbourne to Auckland had reclining foot rests, but a 12 hour flight wouldn't? Furthermore, the seats are so close that when the person in front of me is reclined, if I'm not reclined, I can barely move. Unless something changes drastically by the next time we go back to New Zealand/Australia, I will not be taking Air New Zealand. On a side note, the staff try to be friendly and helpful, but that is their job. I can't really say that they are any more or less friendly/helpful that staff on other airlines. The food was decent. The wine is always nice. Entertainment needs to be updated. On a good note, the flight from Melbourne to Auckland on July 11th was fantastic. But, the other 3 flights I've had with Air NZ, including this one were terrible.", "air_title": "Air New Zealand ", "Customer_name": "B Kris"}
