The seat comfort in Economy Class is bad compared to other airlines. Even for people with a normal body height, it is not comfortable to sit for 8-9 hours. Sleeping is nearly impossible due to steep position of seat back. Due to excellent reputation of airline, I still tend to travel with LH and recommend to friends.", "air_title": "Lufthansa ", "Customer_name": "A Schaberg"}
