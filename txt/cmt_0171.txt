I used AVIOS points for these flights and had booked in World Traveller Plus. From the moment I boarded at LHR terminal 5. I was addressed by name throughout the flight. (I have a BA Executive Club Silver Card.) The cabin crew couldn't have been more friendly, yet discreet. Offered a glass of champagne, extra wine and post dinner drinks. I was given a very warm welcome. On the return from JFK I was surprised, and pleased, to have been given an upgrade to Club World, in spite of travelling on a Reward Flight. This meant I was able to use the pre-flight supper in the JFK lounge, which is so much better than eating during the flight, so I was able to maximise sleep. I couldn't have been more pleased with the service I received on both legs. When BA gets it right, it is in a class of its own; friendly, personal yet very unobtrusive service.", "air_title": "British Airways ", "Customer_name": "David Graham"}
