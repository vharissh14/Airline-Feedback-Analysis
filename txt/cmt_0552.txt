Multiple delays before take off resulting in missed connection and an overnight stay in Tokyo. Very poor communication from staff and despite promises made about contacting my waiting family - none made! They made no effort to get me on earliest flight possible - just you will take what you are given mentality. Due to late arrival and early departure - no evening meal or breakfast was available (despite vouchers). Then had to bus transfer across to Haneda - then discover I could have caught an earlier flight. Air New Zealand is a very poor airline, trading on what used to be a good reputation.", "air_title": "Air New Zealand ", "Customer_name": "R Bain"}
