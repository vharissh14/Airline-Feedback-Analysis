Outbound flight on an A321 in business, great service, relaxing and comfortable, improved greatly being addressed by name by the crew who were very funny and friendly, great food and drinks on flight leaving London at 8:30 in the morning. Return on a 767 in Economy, great service and very relaxing, brilliant food and drink even in Economy and once again friendly crew and brilliant seats. After a few trips over the months it appears BA is definitely improving with such brilliant service!", "air_title": "British Airways ", "Customer_name": "H Kieran"}
