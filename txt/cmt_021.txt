The crew not good. Whenever I tried to call the crew for help they just turned off the signal and never came. As I travelled with two children I needed it wasn't possible to always go to the galley. Many passengers were facing the same problem. I had a good experience with them during my domestic flights. This is first time I travelled with them outside of India and wouldn't consider it again.", "air_title": "Jet Airways ", "Customer_name": "Gurbir Gill"}
