Seat pitch adequate for my 6'1' husband but footrest is useless, does not come up high enough for anyone. Recline adequate for nap. Attentive staff. Meals well presented and fairly good. Entertainment system needs refurbishment, remotes in both directions needed work and sound wasn't working properly in my seat on the return. I'm pretty sure that they used the same equipment on the outbound flight as I heard a person in my (future) seat making the same complaint about the sound on the outbound leg and wasn't surprised (but was disappointed) to discover that it had not been fixed a week later (or if fixed broke again already). Choice of entertainment good when working. Efficient ground staff. Notification of delay on the return was timely and adequate. Amenity kit and water bottle holder very useful, but avoid front row of premium economy where it just becomes an annoyance because there is no storage.", "air_title": "Air New Zealand ", "Customer_name": "N Leslie"}
