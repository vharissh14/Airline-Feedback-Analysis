Aircraft was a B777-200. The interior was quite old. Food choices were limited in quantity and since I was sitting at second to last row (64), twice both dinner and breakfast I was left with whatever available and none of them suited me. Air NZ does not provide toothbrush and toothpaste which are available on Cathay Pacific and Singapore long haul flight. In terms of in-flight entertainment, movies were out dated. My audio socket was dead on the right output. Air NZ stewards seem to be over casual. The most irritating thing was Air NZ allowed only a single piece check-in baggage where Cathay Pacific and Singapore allow two.", "air_title": "Air New Zealand ", "Customer_name": "Tran Huy"}
