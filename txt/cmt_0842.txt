My economy experience was great! I was very surprised with the flight and service. The food was not excellent but neither was it poor - it was just right. I got my food on time and staff were very helpful, seats were very comfortable. However, the inflight entertainment was a little out of date and did not have many choices. Overall though, I would definitely recommend Lufthansa.", "air_title": "Lufthansa ", "Customer_name": "Sami Osman"}
