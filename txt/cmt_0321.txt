Practically everything went off perfectly - less jet noise than on other aircraft, decent food, great leg-room and seat width, a relaxing cabin layout and a top-notch cabin crew (no rating for entertainment since apart from the flight tracker I don't use it) - even the boarding and disembarkation, despite being on two levels, seemed more orderly than in the past on other aircraft. A success all round.", "air_title": "British Airways ", "Customer_name": "Vincent Borlaug"}
