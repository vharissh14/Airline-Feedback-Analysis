I flew to LAX on the A380 which was ok but flying back on the BA 747 was a truly forgettable experience. It was in such poor shape and the staff were hopeless. The inflight entertainment was virtually non existant and seating was cramped. I flew the next day onto Hong Kong with Cathay which is head and shoulders above BA. For the amount it costs, there are so many better alternatives.", "air_title": "British Airways ", "Customer_name": "J Hill"}
