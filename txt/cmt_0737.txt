Had the opportunity to fly LH456 from Frankfurt to Los Angeles in Economy (normally I fly business). Was impressed by the overall high standard (the new B-747 I guess) and inflight entertainment is top of the tops. Small disappointment in food and beverage: Food: overall quality good, chicken run out two rows before us, so pasta only choice. In addition I do not understand why proper bread is not served instead of this white thing that resembles bad quality (Germany has good bread) Beverage: fail to understand why you get 2nd rate prosecco / sparkling and wines. Furthermore non-alcoholic beer was not available on flight. That is cost-saving on the wrong level in my opinion.", "air_title": "Lufthansa ", "Customer_name": "R Jakab"}
