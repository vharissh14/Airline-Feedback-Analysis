Flight was very nice and punctual! Service very good! Business Class Lounge (of United) in Chicago is rubbish! Not really worth going there! No Flair, no real comfort - just very cold and without any expression! Biggest disappointment on this trip! Otherwise the flight was good!", "air_title": "Lufthansa ", "Customer_name": "Benussi Patrizio"}
