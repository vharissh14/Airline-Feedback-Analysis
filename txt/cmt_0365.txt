I cannot understand why BA have chosen the seating arrangement in Club World on the new A380 with one seat facing forward and the seat next to you facing backwards so as to be facing your neighbour. Food reasonable and service OK but not overly attentive. Return flight in Premium Economy, seats not as comfortable as in the 767.", "air_title": "British Airways ", "Customer_name": "Roger Bowler"}
