We were upgraded to Premiere as there was a double booking for our seats. Short flight so meal service began immediately after cruising. The pursers were selectively asking passengers for meal choices. Those left were told no non -veg options, only a veg option left. I refused and he asked me if I wanted fruit or dessert, I declined and asked for tea. After every passenger was served their meals and their coffee tea service in trays, one of the crew dumped a cup of tea on my tray. Considering I had asked for one item, I would have expected a tea tray, offered at the same time as the other service. Anyway, I really do not expect much from the arrogant and indifferent crew, having had bad experiences in the past with Jet we only fly them on short flights.", "air_title": "Jet Airways ", "Customer_name": "S Syed"}
