On the trip to Nadi they had chicken or salmon but by the time they got to our row (which was only on row 18) they had run out of the chicken. The terrible thing about it was how the flight attendant approached the situation. She said \"we've ran out of the chicken and only have salmon, will you be happy with that.\". No apologies or any kind word to say to a passenger who paid extra for the food! On the return trip, same scenario. Except they had a choice of chicken or lamb and they ran out of chicken. Considering we were only in row 15 (and there were so many more rows behind us) to run out of the more popular choice that early on is just not right. I would've been okay with it but the flight attendant gave that same annoying line again \"will you be happy with that?\". The problem is, I do not eat lamb. After I said to the attendant I don't eat lamb she said there was a vegetarian meal that no one has claimed, will I be happy with that? again, that line! I didn't think I had a choice so yes, I will have it but I cannot say I am happy with it.", "air_title": "Air New Zealand ", "Customer_name": "Nieves Rosanna"}
