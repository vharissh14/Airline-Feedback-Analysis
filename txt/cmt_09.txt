I though I was unlucky on my flight from London to Mumbai, but the crew on the return trip were possibly worse. Clearly passengers are an inconvenience that should just go to sleep and not bother the crew. I was refused a coffee as we were an hour from landing (even though they still hadn't finished clearing from breakfast so it should have been a simple ask). Another major annoyance were the tannoy announcements all through the night telling us we were entering turbulence so should fasten our seatbelts. Most humane airlines mention at the start of a night flight that passengers should keep their belt visible so that they don't have to wake us. There were only 15 movies on offer, of which only 2 or 3 are new releases. I won't go into details on the food, I handed it back and got extra bread instead (though the guy was reluctant to even provide this). Hopefully never again.", "air_title": "Jet Airways ", "Customer_name": "C Martinez"}
