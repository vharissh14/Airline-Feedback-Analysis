First Class Seat 1K. Crew unprofessional, most of the time forgot seat 1K existed with no welcome drink until 15 mins had passed, no water top up until I asked (3 times), forgot wine match with first course and everything handed out with \"ok?\" as a comment. New tasting menu was very good. Had a flight in business with CX a few days later and the food quality, crew and overall service was another league - far outshone BA. The BA First product is a waste of money and crew need a re-train.", "air_title": "British Airways ", "Customer_name": "A Ferguson"}
