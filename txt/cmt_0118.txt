Food is always the same (hasn't changed in 3 years), films only change every 3 months (maybe) and they are the same selection outbound and inbound. Service is average. There is zero recognition of Gold or Platinum international members loyalty (except for use of very poor below standard lounge at Delhi).", "air_title": "Jet Airways ", "Customer_name": "A Kyprianou"}
