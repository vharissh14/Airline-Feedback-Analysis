The overall product still good but need some update on aircraft and seat desing. Sometimes the window seat can fell a bit narrow, with no extra space for your personals. On the other hand, good service, fast connection at LHR, great lounge, FA nice and attentive. IFE good choice of movies, nice food (not great). Will fly them again.", "air_title": "British Airways ", "Customer_name": "J Bacallado"}
