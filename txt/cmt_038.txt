I have always used Jet Airways whenever possible to adjust in my flight legs. I find their service to be better than other Indian carriers (or international carriers for that matter). Their selection of IFE is huge and diverse. The aircraft is newer than most European/American carriers, and thus have more advanced features like larger screens, easy navigation/selection etc. The food selection is also nice and include a combination of both regional and international meal options. Finally, the group and air crew service, attitude and willingness to help stands out. They are courteous and have a good deal of professionals, makes you feel you're in good hands. I would fly Jet whenever possible!", "air_title": "Jet Airways ", "Customer_name": "A Sijapati"}
