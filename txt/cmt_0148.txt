Two good flights. Orderly check-in. Great crew. Food mostly quite good although if a salad is going to comprise a few lettuce leaves and a chopped up tomato, frankly don't bother. Flights pretty much on time. Both very busy. Breakfast on arrival in London was poor too. IFE is horrendously behind competitors. Really dire. Ran out of options after about half an hour. Some airlines offer thousands of films and programmes. The crew are the best part of BA as the seats and catering are not up to much. Check in was excellent at both ends. There was a minor system glitch at Punta Cana which meant a short delay but a member off staff came through the queue to keep us all informed. Top notch.", "air_title": "British Airways ", "Customer_name": "J Tydeman"}
