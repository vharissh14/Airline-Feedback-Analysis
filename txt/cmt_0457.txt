Plane was old, tatty 737 but at least we got the 34\" of legroom which the refitted planes no longer have. Flights were on time both ways, food was reasonably good & cabin staff were charming (specially on the outboard flight). I was surprised to find BA no longer has a Club Lounge at Paphos and even more surprised to find that there was a comfortable lounge there that BA Club Europe passengers were unable to use. We were given vouchers as compensation and thought we would at least get a glass of wine and a sandwich - but no. The vouchers were of such low value they could only be redeemed for things like a local beer, crisps and chewing gum. Even though the flights were quite good I feel that BA are treating their Club Europe passengers with contempt by denying them any lounge access or reasonable compensation - also by refitting their aircraft to give passengers less seat width and the same legroom as economy. Why pay a premium price for a non premium product?", "air_title": "British Airways ", "Customer_name": "K Jackson"}
