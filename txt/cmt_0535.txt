It was a tired old plane and the movie selection was pretty tired also. Food was ok but a second cup of tea was hard to obtain. The cabin was clean. The seat was adequate. Crew members were amiable. The guy in the aisle seat had no where else to put his long legs, he seemed about 6 foot six inches tall, except in the aisle which was not good for anybody. It was part of a round the world fare and did not seem great value to me. Next time I will check a direct flight to LHR, our final destination, and side trips from there.", "air_title": "Air New Zealand ", "Customer_name": "C Hall"}
