The galleries lounge at Gatwick offers a terrible service - food normally consists of poorly made sandwiches, pasta, and other non discript offerings! Priority boarding was announced for those travelling in CW, unfortunately this was not managed and it just turned into a free for all. The crew were friendly and offered a good service. BA's club product is now very dated and they need to look at ways to improve the comfort and inflight service. The so called CW pantry is laughable, soggy, inedible wraps, pasta served in plastic containers, crisps and small chocolate bars is not acceptable in this day and age. The inflight meal was adequate but not memorable, the afternoon tea was somewhat better but no care went into it's presentation, the sandwiches were left in their plastic wrapping which was disappointing. The return flight was awful, the crew were miserable and clearly didn't want to be there. One member of the crew was very rude to an elderly lady who was clearly having issues adjusting the seat and dared to ask for help. The meal just awful, dry, bland and totally inedible. The breakfast served prior to landing at Gatwick consisted of a bacon roll which was vile, the bread roll was rock hard and should not have been served. Very poor flight which was made worse but a very inattentive and miserable crew.", "air_title": "British Airways ", "Customer_name": "Rob Jones"}
