Excellent! I thought it was a new A320, but FA told me it was not new, it was refurbished. Well done BA on a good re-design: new lighting, seats, clever seat-back storage etc. I believe they've reduced the economy seat pitch, but the design is such that you don't notice. Dinner was served on this evening flight - a very tasty Chicken curry with cheese/crackers and chocolate mousse desert. A very decent meal for a 4-hour flight in economy. FAs were courteous and efficient. The only negative was security at LHR T5, where there was a long delay because of installation of new machines and security alert that morning.", "air_title": "British Airways ", "Customer_name": "I Lancaster"}
