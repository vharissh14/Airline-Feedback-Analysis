Having flown Cathay Pacific on three long haul sectors I was looking forward to the flight. I was so disappointed and astounded how bad their business class product has become. Both the food and wine were not up to standard. The Airshow system was not working and the entertainment choices were very poor. The seats are not lie flat until you complete something akin to a military exercise to set up a bed with a mattress. Cost cutting measures are so evident as even the bread rolls look smaller and the hot face towels given to you look like they have been cut in half. The four flight stewards did their best but who on earth decided to dress them in tight waist coats and aprons? Other airlines I have flown provide a far better level of service at a lower fare and I will not be flying Air New Zealand again on their long haul sectors as I do not think they look after their business class passengers like other airlines. Their tenure as a 4 star airline must be looking very shaky indeed.", "air_title": "Air New Zealand ", "Customer_name": "Earl Geoffrey"}
