Our flight to New Plymouth was unable to land due to low cloud and we returned to Auckland, we were told there would no more flights that day and we were rebooked on an early morning flight there was no offer of accommodation or alternative ground transport despite a lot requests for a coach to be laid on we were left at 7pm in Auckland airport with nowhere to stay no offer of any assistance whatsoever. This is the problem when you have a monopoly on regional air services, take it or leave it.", "air_title": "Air New Zealand ", "Customer_name": "Harris Peter"}
