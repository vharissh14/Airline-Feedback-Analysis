Economy class. In many ways ANZ are a great airline. But, the seating on these aircraft's are the tightest I have encountered. I am an average build male and had to squeeze myself into my seat. If the passenger in front decides to recline their seat be prepared to wear your meal. I have travelled overseas on several 'budget' airlines and have had more room. This configuration is fine for a 40 minute AKL-WLG flight but not for a 4 hour flight with meals.", "air_title": "Air New Zealand ", "Customer_name": "Terry McKenna"}
