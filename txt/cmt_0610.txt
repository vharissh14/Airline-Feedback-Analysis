Seat+Bag ticket. SYD-AKL on larger plane (777). Boarding was an issue - boarding gate too small for size of plane/number of passengers and then many passengers started queuing up before boarding called which meant that boarding by row numbers was a bit pointless. Onboard all good as usual although was very cold and I had to get a blanket, also I'm a bit sick of the Hobbit safety video. Service great - lots of staff on hand to help with self check-in and bag drop. Onboard didn't have much to do with staff, but seemed fine as usual. Used ANZ smartphone app for first time - very nice app and easy to use with helpful info. WEL-SYD on A320. Online check-in easy. Much easier boarding with smaller plane. Otherwise flight similar. Overall - not used to the larger plane with longer boarding and alighting time and I don't really like it, so will try to avoid in future bookings. Seats also seemed closer together? Entertainment OK, but could have done with a few more TV shows to choose from. Don't really like their new system of paying extra for the preferential seats, but understand that there is an opportunity for them to make a bit of extra profit there. Glad to have finally got some frequent flyer points for this trans-Tasman flight, as previously they have not given this with the cheaper seats.", "air_title": "Air New Zealand ", "Customer_name": "P List"}
