Food was decent nothing to special for a four hour flight and since we flew on a 737-900 jet there was common TVs throughout the flight so entertainment was hardly any but surprisingly they showed good movies on the flight. So overall experience was alright and I would recommend this airline.", "air_title": "Jet Airways ", "Customer_name": "A Datye"}
