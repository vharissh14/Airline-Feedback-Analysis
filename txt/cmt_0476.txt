My daughter recently took this trip as part of a school trip. The flight was very average, however her comment to me made me laugh. She pressed the call button to ask for some water, it was delivered but was told not to use it again, but actually come and get the water herself. She asked what is the call button for then, to wake to wake you up. The stewards do not see the funny side of her comment.", "air_title": "Air New Zealand ", "Customer_name": "Kiangsri Sathita"}
