As regular Perth trippers (like 25 over 20 years) it was one of the most uncomfortable, disappointing trips we have experienced. One needs to be almost a contortionist to extricate oneself for toilet visits due to 2 things. One is the closeness of the seat in front when it is reclined, coupled with the fact that the intermediate arm rest will not lift high enough to get around comfortably, but having achieved that, one still has to negotiate around the aisle arm rest which would not lift at all! My wife and I are not high body-mass people! Food quality was definitely not up to previous standards. Trying to play a favourite CD became a rather user/unfriendly mission and when I did get it, it was punctuated and disjointed. On disembarking we eyed the PE seats with new interest and are contemplating an upgrade on our return, but it shouldn't have to be like that. We get the feeling that passenger comfort/satisfaction in the standard economy class has been compromised by the extreme pressure the airline is under to return a satisfactory performance to the shareholders. We remain loyal to our own airline, but are seriously questioning the cost.", "air_title": "Air New Zealand ", "Customer_name": "Fleming Alan"}
