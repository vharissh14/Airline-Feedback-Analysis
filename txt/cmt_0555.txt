Great mood lighting in the cabin. We were in row 28JK. The seats are comfortable and stylish and face towards the windows for a great view on take off and landing. The flight crew were smiles all around, offered us a drink before take off, so had a glass of bubbly. Supper was served on this late flight and we both had creamy crab and smoked salmon salad, braised lamb with wholegrain mustard mash and veggies, delicious. Settled down to watch a movie, good selection. With pillow and blanket made myself comfortable in our seats, instructions for the seat are in the seat pocket. Great flight home with great service.", "air_title": "Air New Zealand ", "Customer_name": "V Schmidt"}
