Although our 5th trip with Air NZ this was our first time travelling Business. I was impressed from the moment we were on the plane, we were warmly greeted by the hostess and whilst getting settled were offered a pre-take off drink whilst the other passengers were boarding. At this time they also take an order for your pre-dinner drink to be served once cruising altitude is reached. Drinks and Food came out promptly and was of a high quality, impressed that we were not presented with standard airline food. The lie flat beds were comfortable enough to get a few hours sleep on the long flight and definitely worth the extra money we spent. Entertainment system provided plenty of choice to suit a range of tastes, making the trip going very fast. We had the same positive experience on our flight home and cannot praise Air NZ enough for such an enjoyable journey.", "air_title": "Air New Zealand ", "Customer_name": "L Gascoyne"}
