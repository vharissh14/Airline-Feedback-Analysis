Smart new-looking A320 from T3, which was nice. Early flight so no delays, ahead of the ATC cock-up that day. Good crew there and back, on time and generally excellent service. The one thing which places BA apart from Easyjet (I won't even mention Ryanair) is the speed of cabin service because no money changes hands. On Easyjet the trolley makes glacial progress down the aisle whereas on BA things move much more quickly.", "air_title": "British Airways ", "Customer_name": "Waddell Ian"}
