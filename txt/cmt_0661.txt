I do wish, however, that Lufthansa had not followed the lead of United in the reduction of space in regular economy class and the introduction of a \"premium\" economy class for an excessive amount of additional fare. The space in the \"regular\" economy class has become too tight. Service continues to be good, although the \"snack\" before landing in Chicago left much to be desired. The flight attendants on this particular flight (LH 430 on February 25) provided excellent service in a friendly and accommodating way. The interface between the Lufthansa and connecting United flight was better than I have experienced in the past, although I believe that United continues to be the weak link in the Star Alliance, particularly with regard to US-domestic flights that connect with Lufthansa international flights. United's service simply doesn't compare with Lufthansa's and their flights are frequently delayed or canceled.", "air_title": "Lufthansa ", "Customer_name": "Arthur Mosher"}
