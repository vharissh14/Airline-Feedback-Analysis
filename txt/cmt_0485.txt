Hadn't flown on Air NZ for 10 years and we were keen to see if all the hype around their new \"experience\" was justified, so we paid extra and got \"the works\". We departed on time and arrived 20 minutes early. The amount of legroom in the A320 was a positive revelation as was the extent and content of offerings provided on the in-flight entertainment system. The meal was fine without being exceptional, and the crew was terrific. It really was a pleasure to fly. Thumbs up to Air NZ, based on this flight!", "air_title": "Air New Zealand ", "Customer_name": "P Gerner"}
