The flight was on time, check in was smooth and the staff were very friendly as usual. The seat was comfortable and the bed gave me a great sleep on my overnight flight. Flying Air NZ in any class is very nice, but they do Business Premier very well!", "air_title": "Air New Zealand ", "Customer_name": "T James"}
