Got a decent deal on an airfare but was a bit worried about the reports of the 3-4-3 configuration in Air New Zealand economy. It is very tight and this is magnified on a long flight. For me no amount of service compensated for the feeling of being jammed in like sheep. Clearly the bottom line is the only thing that matters. What was once one of the best economy classes in the sky has literally devolved into sardine class. In the future I would take longer routing to avoid Air New Zealand.", "air_title": "Air New Zealand ", "Customer_name": "James Homes"}
