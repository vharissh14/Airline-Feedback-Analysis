Never heard of them so looked them up and found this site with some uncomplimentary comments. My expectations were set low, but having flown Business Class with KLM, AF, BA, Thai, and others I think this is the best one. Wonderful service, great food, comfortable seat. Could improve by providing a glass of Champagne before take-off, and better range of entertainment, but everything else excellent, and reasonably priced. Perhaps add premium economy seating?", "air_title": "Jet Airways ", "Customer_name": "I Lambert"}
