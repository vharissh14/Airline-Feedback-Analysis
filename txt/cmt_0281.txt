Very full flights. The online booking/check in system was down for 'technical reasons' for the 24hrs before departure. Consequently my wife and I arrived at LHR well before check in time and were only offered two middle seats in different rows. How is this if the booking system was unavailable? The flight itself was 1hr late departing Terminal 3, not terminal 5 as most other flights with BA. Return flights bookable in Prague so at least got to sit together. Planes were pretty new Airbus A320's, comfortable and well suited to the 1hr 45m flight. The best bit was this was a short break booked via the BA website and included a very central boutique hotel and breakfast for under \u00a3250 each. A nice idea before Christmas with Prague looking it's best with a light dusting of snow.", "air_title": "British Airways ", "Customer_name": "K Fletcher-Biles"}
