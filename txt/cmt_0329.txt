Decided to check a bag in to see how T5 baggage arrivals performed. Pleasant check-in experience. Security marred by a family carrying unrevealed bottles and liquids that was a field day for the security staff and simply a pain for the rest of us queuing behind them. The Cyprus airways lounge whilst much better than its predecessor is still third rate, with a poor selection of food and wine and on this occasion, overcrowded. Wandered to the gate in good time for boarding to be confronted by a flotilla of wheelchair-bound passengers, all of whom get ultra priority boarding. So boarding took longer, despite the fact that whilst Business class was almost full, economy wasn't. On-board service was ok. Hot towels, no menus, drinks and a 3 course meal, salad, main, dessert or cheese, but somehow the service was not as impressive as my outbound. Queue longer to get through the e-passport channel than the regular immigration route, but at least arriving in the baggage hall, our bag was on the carousel. All in all a satisfactory flight.", "air_title": "British Airways ", "Customer_name": "Worcester David"}
