Brilliant flight - namely because of the flight attendants. They were really friendly - not hurried in what they were doing and seemed genuine. The product on this older 747 wasn't great. It was nice having the extra room and smaller cabin in Premium Economy - but the TV screen was tiny and you could tell it was just an out of date aircraft and needed updating! Food was absolutely excellent - beautiful lamb cutlet and beef cheek - best food I've had on an aircraft. Quick flight - reasonably comfortable and would definitely fly again!", "air_title": "British Airways ", "Customer_name": "L Jarvis"}
