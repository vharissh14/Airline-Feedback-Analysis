The London flights were fantastic with great cabin interior, entertainment, food and service, could not fault them! The Mumbai to Bangkok flight was good but not the same as my Bangkok - Delhi flight on my return. The aircraft type (Boeing 737-800) were the same, however the Bangkok to Delhi flight has personal touch screen entertainment and a better meal selection, the Mumbai to Bangkok had drop down screens and not the best of meal selections. However apart from that, flights were all on time, service and comfort were great value for money.", "air_title": "Jet Airways ", "Customer_name": "D Nicholls"}
