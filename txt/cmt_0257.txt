I have no complaints about the inflight experience which was generally very good, although I am not sure that premium economy is really worth the money. What I found completely annoying was the lack of air-bridges both on departure and arrival at T5 Heathrow. We were herded on to buses like cattle, closely resembling the tube at rush hour and then had to climb steep steps into the aircraft, no easy feat with heavy hand luggage and duty free. Are there not enough gates with air bridges at T5? Why is this necessary. I will be flying to Toronto again in September but I am not sure it will be with BA if this situation persists.", "air_title": "British Airways ", "Customer_name": "Mike Rickett"}
