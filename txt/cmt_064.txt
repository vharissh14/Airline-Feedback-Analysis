Other than the seats being slightly cramped, I found the whole experience a pleasant one. The stop over in Abu Dhabi was a little haywire and needs to be tightened up. The flight arrived earlier than the scheduled time of arrival. The entertainment and food was pretty good as well. So overall, I'd give it a 7 out of 10.", "air_title": "Jet Airways ", "Customer_name": "Sam Skariah"}
