Perfect service, very professional, helpful and friendly crew. The food was delicious and a phenomenal variety of wines was served. Everything very clean, comfortable seat that was converted into a bed with very comfortable sheets, where I could get some sleep for several hours. Very clean plane and technically in perfect shape as far as I a business person could see. Great service so I can highly recommend Lufthansa.", "air_title": "Lufthansa ", "Customer_name": "F Biewer"}
