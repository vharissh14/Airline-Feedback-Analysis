I don't normally comment on domestic flights, but these two flights need recognition for the stellar service provided by Air New Zealand. It was two newish A320's either way and manned by some of the best staff I have encountered. We were Star Alliance Gold so had the options of seats in Row 1. Water, tea/coffee and snacks were provided and a second cup was available for anyone that wanted. Well done Air New Zealand!", "air_title": "Air New Zealand ", "Customer_name": "R Connett"}
