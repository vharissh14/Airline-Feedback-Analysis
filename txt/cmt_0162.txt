I don't think I have ever had a flight with BA that wasn't without an issue. Recently, and not for the first time, I checked in to find that Club Class had been over sold. So lets call it what it is.. Greed, it's a disgusting practice. The planes are usually dirty and if you get \"Bumped\" down to Economy the food is awful, while the Cabin crew are mostly helpful and friendly, you don't see them apart from meal time, even when you use the call button, where do they go and what and what are they doing?", "air_title": "British Airways ", "Customer_name": "Desmond Whelan"}
