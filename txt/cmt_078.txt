I had possibly the worst flight experience in all my years of travelling. Non existent fight attendants resulting in a large party of young travellers helping themselves to vast quantities of booze. As a result, I ended up without a seat and the crew kept fobbing me off saying they were trying to sort it. I was left standing for 2.5 hours. Absolutely unacceptable. Never will they get my business again.", "air_title": "Jet Airways ", "Customer_name": "A Williams"}
