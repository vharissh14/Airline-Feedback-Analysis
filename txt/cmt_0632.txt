Plane very old and dirty. Awful smell from the rest room the whole flight. Exit seat - absolutely not worth the money. Food quality and service below average. The price for the flight ticket was very expensive. No air miles for those flights in Miles and More programme.", "air_title": "Air New Zealand ", "Customer_name": "D Kusiak"}
