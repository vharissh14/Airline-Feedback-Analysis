Boarding was stress free both sides as we were Premium Economy, plus Star Alliance Gold and Koru members, so either way we were first on the plane. The flight attendants were available and were there to help right from the start with overhead locker storage etc. Main meals were delivered shortly after take off both ends and the quality of the meals were very similar, if not the same to what I've had in business class, with each course brought out separately. Quality of the alcohol was good, plus it was nice to have a good mug of tea, coffee and after dinner mints afterwards. Amenity Packs were the same as in business class. The seat is multi adjustable and obviously nowhere near lie flat, but after some adjustment, got a nice sleeping position. The seat and footwells accommodated my 6 foot 2 inch frame, my only criticism was the footwell that narrows wouldn't accommodate my size 12\u2019s, so take your shoes off and rest your feet on the bean bag supplied. The crew both ways were excellent. The quality of service was excellent. The seats being pod design mean your personal space is not encroached on, I am disappointed to hear that Premium Economy seating on their Dreamliner, or the 777-200 upgrades will not be using this type of seating.", "air_title": "Air New Zealand ", "Customer_name": "R Connett"}
