Like another reviewer, found the new business cabin to be 'sardine class'. Seats now thin and uncomfortable, especially for a four hour short-haul, narrower and with materially less leg-room than before, the same as economy. Now it is not possible to read a newspaper without turning at an angle to the middle seat, and is impossible to work at a laptop as there is simply not enough room. One wants to like and use BA, but this really is hit wicket in the club cabin. Unusually, in my experience, one of the FAs was rather disinterested in providing the usual club service too.", "air_title": "British Airways ", "Customer_name": "S Tilton"}
