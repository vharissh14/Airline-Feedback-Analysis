We were very pleasantly surprised by the quality. Attentive Cabin Staff, comfortable lie flat seats/beds. Small but excellent choice of wine and champagne. Dinner was of a very good standard and very well presented. Staff made up the beds and the topper was a nice touch on the overnight flight. Transfer at Mumbai to the Domestic Terminal is a pain, but is not Jet Airways fault. The 45 minute flight from Mumbai to Goa was fine too. With a soft drink and a snack meal served. Return flight were very good also and all were virtually on time within a few minutes Before landing the Stewardess came round the Cabin and thanked each passenger for travelling with Jet. A nice personal touch. Jet Staff had taken all the Business Class passengers hold baggage off the carousel, and kindly put it into a roped off area in front of the baggage carousel. Must say the time from plane to exit at LHR was one of the shortest ever experienced! Certainly would travel with Jet again. Excellent value, service and I say with some regret rather better than many recent flights with BA.", "air_title": "Jet Airways ", "Customer_name": "Ian Dewey"}
