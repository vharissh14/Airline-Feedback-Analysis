Great seat, big TV screen, modern and easy to use controls, nice materials everywhere. The seat was comfortable and roomy (I was in the window seat). Entertainment was good. Food was also good and a fair choice. Plenty of beverages. Crew was wonderful, flight attendants were attentive and friendly. The only thing I would recommend - some more privacy. But overall I had a very good experience.", "air_title": "Lufthansa ", "Customer_name": "N Kohut"}
