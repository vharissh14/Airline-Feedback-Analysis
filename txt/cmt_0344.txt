B777 World Traveller cabin. One of the most comfortable economy class flights I have had despite the fact the seating was on the more cramped side. The ambience of the cabin was very calming and soothing and the service from the young crew members enthusiastic, pleasant and courteous. Managed to sleep 6 hours, made the 13 hour shorter. Food was delicious and water runs in between meals very helpful to keep us hydrated. Compared to Air France which is self service, appreciated that BA crew does the water runs. One complaint is the entertainment system which featured touch screen did not work on my seat but small matter. Overall a very relaxing soothing pleasant smooth flight made the 13 hours fly by quickly. This is my new favorite airline to London and offers great value for money compared to Singapore Airlines.", "air_title": "British Airways ", "Customer_name": "Mun Keat David"}
