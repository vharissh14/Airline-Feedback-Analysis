I have had more polite service at Macdonalds than at the desk in the Galleries. There was nothing business class or tranquil about the space. The spa was a fully booked with no appointments for two hours and \"the sorry we can't be of service today\" was more than disappointing especially given the \u00a36K ticket price, and the message was delivered with such insincerity. How can BA get it so right offering 1st Class service in London, Miami, Boston, Seattle, Hong Kong and Sydney (to name a few) and offer budget airline service with a mediocre selection of sandwiches in JFK. Boarding was a mess. They were boarding a Qantas flight at the adjacent gate and all the passengers got mixed up. We asked a BA member of ground staff where to queue and she said she did not know and it had nothing to do with her! First and Business class passengers were directed down a cul-de-sac marked fast track which came to a dead end in a sea of passengers and eventually all the premium passengers joined the line behind the economy passengers and boarded last. We ask \"why\" as the lady gave us back our boarding cards and she said \"nothing to do with me\". Upstairs on the 747 in Club was excellent, professional attentive staff, good food and wine, good entertainment, BA at its best the only flaw was no menu cards because of a mistake at JFK, no surprise. Heathrow ground services were smooth and our bags arrived in no time at all. I will fly BA Clubworld again but not to JKF, I will use Virgin who offer better ground services at JFK which match the price of the ticket and they value their customer more.", "air_title": "British Airways ", "Customer_name": "A Ross"}
