I have difficulty reconciling our positive experiences with the negative comments about flight attendants in other posts here. As we boarded in Nairobi, the purser welcomed us by name and said how pleased they were to have us back again on BA. Before take-off from London, a flight attendant offered the third person in our row a different seat, leaving my wife and me with a vacant seat between us. In all cases, attendants were helpful, cheerful and efficient. Obviously in Club World staff have more time to spend with passengers. With the exception of the late night dinner out of Nairobi, we were impressed with the meal selection and quality. Flights were on time; checked baggage arrived in good condition. Agree that having to pay to reserve seats (if you are not of sufficient One World status) is disappointing. Generally, we remain very pleased with British Air, certainly the best One World option to Europe and beyond from Boston.", "air_title": "British Airways ", "Customer_name": "John Geoffrey Pierson"}
