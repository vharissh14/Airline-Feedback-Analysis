Although in row 2, were ignored until last for our meal service. Both times missed out on our choices, can easily get over that but the order in which cabin crew served people was a mess, made no sense and took forever to complete. Half the time crew didn't know who had served who and on a few occasions, drink orders were forgotten and on asking another crew member to follow up, they continued to leave it to the original crew member who had long forgotten. The order of service was not front to back, back to front or side to side, it was completely random. The rest of row 2 had been served even though we frantically tried to get the crews attention. Paid full fare tickets. Felt completely left out and almost felt like the crew were prejudice against us even though they were lovely chatting to us. Very strange and wouldn't put my money back there to risk being mistreated again.", "air_title": "Air New Zealand ", "Customer_name": "K Robinson"}
