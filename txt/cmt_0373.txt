Check in was quick, as was security and the Oneworld lounge at TBI is pretty good although very crowded. Boarding pretty quick on a packed flight. I found the crew, seating and PTV to be consistent and very good. Flight left more or less on time and landed 30 min early at T5, bags seemed to take ages coming off but a pretty good flight. I don't know what has happened to BA's food offering in WT+ but it has gone down hill recently the 2nd meal wasn't worth serving otherwise good service on a very nice aircraft.", "air_title": "British Airways ", "Customer_name": "C Cutts"}
