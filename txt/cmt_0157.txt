We were expecting at least the same level of comfort and service with BA. The leg room is terrible and only an hour after take off the lady in front put her chair in full recline and made the space in front of me so claustrophobic, I couldn't see the TV screen as it was so close to my face, as well as having to sit at an awkward position as I have long legs and couldn't put them out in front of me. So uncomfortable. The food was dire, with cheap pasta or minuscule fish with more rice After a fortnight of eating rice, it would have been nice to have something different. Does BA actually read and take notice of these negative reviews, are we wasting our time?", "air_title": "British Airways ", "Customer_name": "A Crow"}
