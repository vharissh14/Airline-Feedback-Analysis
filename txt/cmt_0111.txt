Check in was very slow and disorganised, Between standard economy and web check in. The staff were more interested in charging customers for being overweight by 2kg. Inflight cabin crew had a not bothered attitude, and had to ask for water. The service level was like a budget airline. We left late, and then had to wait for 30 min upon landing at Delhi for a gate.", "air_title": "Jet Airways ", "Customer_name": "Dhillon Kulwant Singh"}
