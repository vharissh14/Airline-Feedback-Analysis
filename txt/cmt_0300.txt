Outbound flight - an older 747-400 showing signs of age. Crew not too friendly and were not seen after dinner service. Only one drink offered. Quite impressed with dinner, filet of beef which I believe was from Club menu. Breakfast sadly was a cold croissant and jam. Return flight much better with attentive crew. Double dose of drink was a nice start. Again, served a filet of beef from Club menu which was very good. Older 747-400s need retiring very soon. Premium economy seats are ok but get cramped after a few hours of sitting.", "air_title": "British Airways ", "Customer_name": "Tony Banwait"}
