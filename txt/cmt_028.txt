Lovely aircraft, good seating, but no in flight entertainment; whereas as Jet Airways claim to include entertainment on international flights. Meal abysmal, vegetable curry, best part was the small loaf and butter. Kathmandu - London Heathrow sector. Fine 777 aircraft, entertainment unit included, overall good, but no flight path view availability. Seating good. Food a bit better. Chicken roll, surprisingly followed by Choc ice-cream, this best food outward and return trips. Otherwise food again disappointed in extreme, outward legs LHR - Kathmandu via New Delhi. No genuine Western food options.", "air_title": "Jet Airways ", "Customer_name": "M Darlow"}
