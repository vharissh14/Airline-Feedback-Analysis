They had 4 crew serving Economy. The crew were plainly incompetent and not interested. No smiles, no greeting, no warmth. They were badly groomed. They couldn't bother to serve my VLML meal even though it was listed in their manifest until I had to insist that they search for it. They never came by with a tray of drinks/water for the second time on a 5+ hr flight. They could not be bothered do the pre-flight checks and during take-off and landing. On the plus side, the A330-200 cabin was clean, leg room was OK, not great. Flight was on time and piloting was good.", "air_title": "Jet Airways ", "Customer_name": "Purna Ananth"}
