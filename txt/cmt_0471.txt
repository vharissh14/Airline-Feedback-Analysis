Delayed take-off from Rome largely because the plane was held on the runway for nearly 30 mins. Cabin clean and in good condition. Staff attentive and professional. Seats adequate for short journey but legroom is not generous. Food ans drink welcome but the food poor and unnecessary on relatively short journey.
