Pros: Lighting, window blinds, large TV, personal storage, PJs and food. Cons: Seat does not conform to lounge chair without activation of sleeper section. No bedding provided except used throw pillow from last seating. Four middle seats crowd the area too much. Bathroom very small. Cabin was very, very dirty. Advise, fly AA 777 or 77W on same route.", "air_title": "British Airways ", "Customer_name": "S Balaz"}
