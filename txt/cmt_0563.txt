My first experience was not one to remember. San Francisco to Auckland on an old plane with ripped seats, flight 7, seat A40. The entertainment system was broken in my seat, nice job for 12 hours watching nothing with no seats to move to. Once I arrived to Auckland found out not only was my first trip cancelled to Palmerston North but they cancelled it again for the second time, each time having to retrieve my luggage and go through the process all over. Then to add insult to the situation they put me on my third flight, now 6 hours after when I was supposed to fly and there was a flight which left in between this time frame and I wasn't put on that because it was \"oversold\". My advice don't fly them.", "air_title": "Air New Zealand ", "Customer_name": "F Donald Eichman"}
