The seat booking system is not working at all. Estimate 75% of cases the seat cancellation is performed without any background - it is very disappointing. Flight LH2023 is a classical example of another incomprehensible situation - nearly every day the \"business class\" (which in LH's case is nothing but economy divided by curtain from the rest of the plane) is extended till row 12, making 48 business seats, while occupation is 3 - 5 \"business\" passengers. Remaining travellers are squeezed in the back, while front section is entirely empty. Another trick is to extend the \"business class\" for 24 hours to row 19, remove all forward seats reservations, and then return back to the original configuration. Why they do it is a mystery to me. LH obviously don't like their status customers in the front of the aircraft.", "air_title": "Lufthansa ", "Customer_name": "M Petr"}
