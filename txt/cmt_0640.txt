Both flights had the new Business Class seat which is excellent. On both flights the crew were attentive and smiling, and the food was very good. Check in at Kuwait was fast and efficient as was the boarding (for an early departure). The flight was short at just over 5 hours 30 minutes but the crew was relaxed and not rushed, offering drinks, a nice snack and a choice of breakfast. Returning from Frankfurt was equally pleasurable from check in to arrival with only a small delay due to congestion at Frankfurt Airport. Another good flight to Kuwait, with equally good crew and catering. Impressive.", "air_title": "Lufthansa ", "Customer_name": "Ian Patrick"}
