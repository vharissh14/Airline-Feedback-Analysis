This airline can change seats on you suddenly and you find out at the airport. I had a confirmed seat on a long-haul flight (AKL-HKG) and the seat that was allocated to me on my booking was given to someone else. No explanation, just a bunch of lies. This could be a real problem if you are travelling with your family and all of a sudden can find out that you are all over the place. Also, I tried to check in online but this airline does not allow you to do so if your ticket was issued by a travel agent (which business tickets often are). Apparently you have to purchase directly through them online in order to use the online check-in service. Had a long argument with their web support guy who couldn't seem to understand why this is so rotten. He just defended what they do This is a beautiful country with great people. They need to do something about their national airline though!", "air_title": "Air New Zealand ", "Customer_name": "Chaudhuri Avijit"}
