We made the reservation many months ago, attempted several times to select seats and were told we could not do so in advance, but needed to wait until we got to the airport. This was our first time flying with them, and every other airline we have ever flown has allowed us to sit together. It is usually assumed that if we are married, and making the reservation together at the same time using one credit card, and paying a lot for the trip, that we actually want to sit next to each other. When we tried to change our seats to be together, all representatives said being separated was typical. Which is strange, because then you have a plane full of families that have been physically separated for no apparent reason. While it's always fun to meet new strangers, we will not be flying with British Airways again.", "air_title": "British Airways ", "Customer_name": "J Dob"}
