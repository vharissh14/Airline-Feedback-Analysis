Flight on time. Crew professional and friendly. Regular water runs for overnight flight. Meals were good. IFE provides a good selection but would have benefited from more new releases. Seats were comfortable and I managed to get some sleep. Aisles were somewhat narrow and I understand that the seat configuration is being changed to 3-4-3. I do wonder how uncomfortable this would make this 12 hour flight.", "air_title": "Air New Zealand ", "Customer_name": "M Lam"}
