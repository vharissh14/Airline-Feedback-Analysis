This time the Lufthansa experience was not as impeccable as I am used to. On the long flight during the day from Frankfurt to Dallas the IFE system never started up. This made the journey feel a bit longer than the 10 hours it actually took. Apart from that, the service, the food, and the comfort was very good. Without asking for it, I was also offered a very generous amount of frequent flyer points as compensation a few weeks afterwards.", "air_title": "Lufthansa ", "Customer_name": "Marcus Nyberg"}
