Wrong! My 15 year old son and I travelled from LHR-NYC on BA but it was a code-share with American Airlines. I couldn't check in online so we stood in the long queue and couldn't book an aisle seat either. BA at the airport apparently couldn't help because it was a code-share even though I had bought through BA! The flight was on time and seats a reasonable size. Coming back we flew from Washington Dulles airport - there was a snow storm and it was freezing. The plane which was an Airbus 380 was supposed to leave at 6.35pm and showing departing \"on time\" not until 6.15 pm on the 21st Feb. Then BA Announced a 20 min delay which sounded reasonable considering the weather outside and all the other planes were delayed or cancelled! We were all boarded on the plane when they announced the plane was too heavy to be pushed out and there was too much snow behind the plane so they called the snow ploughs! We sat on the plane for 6 hours with no food or refreshments except water! There was nowhere for us go apparently so we couldn't get off the plane. It doesn't take a rocket scientist to work out that with all the snow and a huge airplane that there would be large problems. The final straw was after 5 hrs and the third attempt to move the plane was that we had to sit for another 45 mins defrosting the wings! British Airways were not prepared to cancel or reschedule the flight but instead made us sit like cattle on the airplane. It's a disgrace and we they will probably put it down to bad weather and not negligence, bad planning or bad management on their part! Time to look at a new airline to fly with.", "air_title": "British Airways ", "Customer_name": "Louise Robinson"}
