Flew Air New Zealand from Melbourne - Auckland and then Auckland - Los Angeles - both legs in business class. Had issue with bags as initially they refused to transfer them from one flight to another because they were separate tickets, meaning I would have only 1 hour 50 minutes to go through NZ immigration/customs and then recheck for the LA flight. I was astounded and eventually they relented, agreeing to do it making it clear that it was only because I was in business class. Cabin crew on both legs were great, food was excellent. Disliked the herringbone window seat arrangements as made it hard to see out of the windows. My allocated seat was not available as it had malfunctioned, so they had seated me in another next to the galley which I objected to. I was then moved to another seat but the gate agent did not tell me that this too was near a galley. Not impressed! The seat on the AKL-LAX leg was comfortable but just not up to scratch. If you wanted to lie flat, you had get out of the seat and then it was folded down and a mattress put on top. This means you could not sit up easily during the night as to sit up, the mattress had to be removed and the seat unfolded and returned to an upright or semi-reclined position. Kind of all or nothing! Lack of storage in seat area. Would I fly Air NZ again? Only if the price was right.", "air_title": "Air New Zealand ", "Customer_name": "J Pearson"}
