We were a family of 9 (3 generations) and this was our 1st experience with this airline. We were pleasantly surprised after reading such negative reviews. Flight attendants were helpful and courteous, seats were adequate, food was fine and our flights were on time and we arrived safely. I do not know what people expect, our needs were met, it was an overall pleasant experience.", "air_title": "Jet Airways ", "Customer_name": "S O'Neill"}
