They have really improved their service offering. Now you get slippers and socks, which does make perfect sense when you want to go to the restroom. They serve champagne in champagne glasses and finally serve espresso too. The crew to SIN was very friendly and courteous and took great care of us. On the return it was a little less overwhelming, less smiles. IFE in general great, more quality than quantity, I prefer that. On return flight our screens didn't work and they didn't do much about it apart from suggesting we should sleep. Middle eastern Airlines really made a point and now all the others must follow if they want to stay in business. Advantage goes to LH, their crews interact with customers .It's all a bit bland but what you see is what you get.", "air_title": "Lufthansa ", "Customer_name": "Ford Alexander"}
