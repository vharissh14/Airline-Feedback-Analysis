January 2015. Have not flown out of the Tom Bradley International Terminal at LAX for years, but it's now much improved. Check in and bag drop a breeze, as was security, and in the oneworld lounge in minutes. Good choice of food and drinks, and plenty of space. Short-ish walk to the gate, good welcome on board, and drinks served quickly. Couldn't fault any aspect of the experience, and we took off and landed on time, and managed a good five hours sleep out of the ten hours duration. Love the Arrivals Lounge at LHR. A civilising shower and 2nd breakfast sets you up for the day.", "air_title": "British Airways ", "Customer_name": "James Little"}
