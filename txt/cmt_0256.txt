I was accompanied by my wife, a son and daughter with their spouse's and our 2 year old grandson. Between us all, we spent a considerable amount of money to fly economy class. After a short time into the flight, we soon discovered the economy seats on the 777 to be extremely small, uncomfortably close to the seats in front of us with almost no legroom and armrest that only fold up halfway! I wonder what genius came up with that one. Aside from serving us \"steerage\" passengers that stuff they called food and a drink, we never saw the cabin crew in both directions. They wouldn't even come around to collect the trash so we sat amidst it. They didn't even check to see if my grandson needed anything. As far as flying BA again, there wont be a next time.", "air_title": "British Airways ", "Customer_name": "R Rodway"}
