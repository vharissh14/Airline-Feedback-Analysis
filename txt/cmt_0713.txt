I have flown 73 times with Lufthansa in the last 7 years. My flights BEG - FRA - ADDIS (via Jeddah) and return business class were very disappointing. Frankfurt - Addis is a long flight. Old aircraft, old tilting seats, old films old system, unimaginative food, no difference on the way back. Crew change in Jeddah, swapped one good cheery crew for another.", "air_title": "Lufthansa ", "Customer_name": "J Harston"}
