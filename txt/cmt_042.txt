Flying an international route of Jet after 4 years. Flight was on time. Aged aircraft that should not have been flown on an overseas route. Seats cushions were so thin that it felt like sitting on a metal seat. Leg room was totally inadequate for a 4 hour flight. Wonder if seat pitch was just 29\". Food was reasonably good but standard of service seems to have gone down in the last 4 years. Jet should definitely fly newer planes with better interiors and seat pitch on international routes.", "air_title": "Jet Airways ", "Customer_name": "V Sitaraman"}
