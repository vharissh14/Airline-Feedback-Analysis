I had a seat each for me and my two kids, both under 5. All of the crews were fantastic with them, going out of their way to assure our comfort. The crew as we approached LHR were exceptional and took the initiative of laying on a \"Meet & Assist\" at LHR which was such a help and a great touch. Check in at AKL was brilliant, abysmal at LHR, but that was the only down point of an otherwise excellent trip. Kids loved the most of the food, though spaghetti is a tough one to feed a toddler on a plane! Didn't get a chance to test the TV, I grabbed sleep when the kids slept!", "air_title": "Air New Zealand ", "Customer_name": "S Derecourt"}
