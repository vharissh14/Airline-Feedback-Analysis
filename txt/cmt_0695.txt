I choose Lufthansa pretty often since I like their competence, services, flexibility regarding the luggage and their on-time flights. The aircraft's I have flown with were mostly in good to excellent conditions. There is often a good communication from the captain about the flight conditions and so on. Friendly and efficient staff. Sometimes fares could be a little expensive but it is easy to find interesting prices. I would definitely recommend this airline to everybody.", "air_title": "Lufthansa ", "Customer_name": "F Livi"}
