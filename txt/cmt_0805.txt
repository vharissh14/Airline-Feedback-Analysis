Direct flight in a Airbus 330 which seems to be a small aircraft for such a long 10 hour flight. Food in Y class as bad as always on European airlines. Seats extremely narrow for such a long haul flight (OK for European or continental flights but for Intercontinental flights not enough space). Service as good as it can get in this class. Beverage OK but below standard compared for many airlines particularly in comparison to Asian or Gulf region carriers. Entertainment system really bad (old films that I can hardly remember from my youth). Seat distribution unclear and not well thought through (eg LH has an initiative for \"doctors on board\" and medics can subscribe to this program, however flight attendants do not seem to be aware of this initiative, in addition medics obviously are not listed thus unknown and do not get seats easy to be prepared for emergencies. Instead they are often seated in the middle of the rows thus hindering them to quickly react).", "air_title": "Lufthansa ", "Customer_name": "Samson Fung"}
