Check in and cabin crew friendly. Decent snack served on this 2 hr flight. Departed on time and arrived early. The slimline seat provided extra legroom and was OK for this length flight, but may be a bit hard if the sector is longer. Very happy to use again, at least on European sectors.", "air_title": "Lufthansa ", "Customer_name": "W Coulton"}
