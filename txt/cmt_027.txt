Had seat row 50 exit seat plenty of room but no window. Crew on outward flight from Heathrow great, plenty of chat, short flight from Mumbai to Goa average and very short 45 mins. Same on the way back from Goa to Mumbai but crew not good at all on Mumbai to London flight, as previously stated they were more interested in chatting with each other rather than serving customer.", "air_title": "Jet Airways ", "Customer_name": "Mike Kirton"}
