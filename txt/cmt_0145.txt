On time in both directions, staff were professional and polite. Sandwich out and a choice of snacks (crisps, biscuits or chocolate raisins) in as well as complementary drinks, including alcohol. Smooth through Geneva airport in and out; stuck in a 40-minute passport queue at LGW on the way in (not BA's fault of course) followed by a long walk around renovation work for the airport shuttle to the train station. This was a rare occasion where BA was cheaper than all of the competition on the route. On balance, I just don't think the BA experience is much better than the low-cost competition unless you fly to Heathrow, where Terminal 5 is much nicer than Gatwick. Although the food and drink is free, the choice is quite limited (e.g. no British beer, no option to buy something substantial if you're hungry and the snack was a bit stingy on the way back). I thought we might get newspapers but we didn't. On balance, it was perfectly fine but I wouldn't pay the extra for BA - I'd actually rather have the choice, friendliness and flexibility you get with easyJet.", "air_title": "British Airways ", "Customer_name": "C Watson"}
