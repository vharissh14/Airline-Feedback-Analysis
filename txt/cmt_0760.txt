Our confirmed seatings were all messed up despite we have booked this in Feb 14. It took us 40 minutes at KLIA Lufthansa counter to sort this out - each couple were seated together but the group had to split up. On our return leg (7 Nov 14) our group confirmed seats were again messed up despite reconfirming the seat 3 days before our departure with Lufthansa Malaysia. The check in counter staff was not helpful nor friendly at CDG airport to help us to reassign our seats so that each couple could sit together but the group was split up again. The return flight (Paris to Frankfurt LH1043) was re-timed later by 20 minutes but we were not informed and the flight arrived late at Frankfurt. So we had to run for our connecting flight to KL. There were no Lufthansa Staff at the gate to provide assistance.", "air_title": "Lufthansa ", "Customer_name": "K Lam"}
