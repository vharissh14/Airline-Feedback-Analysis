On each occasion we were really impressed by the service. The food was great (more than I could eat on on occasion), the sensitivity to those wanting to sleep and those wanting to be provided food and or drink was terrific, and the smiles seemed to be genuine (even at the end of a long haul flight - some achievement). We flew Economy Class Air NZ in 2008 and had the same superb service. It's not what you pay, it's who you fly with, and Air NZ is in the very top shelf.", "air_title": "Air New Zealand ", "Customer_name": "Bissell Julie"}
