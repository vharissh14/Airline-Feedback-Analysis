First flight to LHR was great with an informative Captain and friendly efficient staff on a refurbished A320. Cabin is really smart. Arrived into LHR early which is a pleasant change despite the enforced 'stacking' that happens to flights landing at Heathrow. Return flight was great too due to the Captain and crew, great service on a full flight however the A319 cabin was the old type and boy did it show! Overall a good experience with BA.", "air_title": "British Airways ", "Customer_name": "S Davison"}
