Munich to JFK. The cabin crew are efficient but not especially friendly. Food is awful and always the same: Chicken or pasta (it's a well known joke between people traveling often to and from this destination). Not a fan of the new seats, less comfortable than the old ones, especially if you are more than 6\"2 like me.", "air_title": "Lufthansa ", "Customer_name": "S Sheppard"}
