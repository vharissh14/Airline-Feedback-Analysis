Club World on ex BMI A321, so a different seat to the usual BA Club World product. Overall an excellent flight and service all round. The crew in Club World were a real credit to BA and could not do enough for you. Catering was excellent, the seat was very comfortable in all positions and the airport experience at all ends was quick and easy. Overall an excellent premium product made even more special by the cabin crew.", "air_title": "British Airways ", "Customer_name": "D MacDonald"}
