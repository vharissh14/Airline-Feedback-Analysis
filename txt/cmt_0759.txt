Cabin crew service is okay for a European carrier. Smiling faces welcomes you on boarding until the end of the flight. Very attentive and skilled. Seating and entertainment not the best still bearable for a short flight but can't imagine these standards for +5 hours. Lunch provided was delicious however not many choices on offer. Overall a good flight with only minor draw backs.", "air_title": "Lufthansa ", "Customer_name": "Demet Erdogan"}
