Despite their marketing campaign on many Lufthansa flights to the US and elsewhere there are still the old business class seats installed. I was on the Orlando - Frankfurt flight. Those seats are not good. Hard, not good for sleeping, not 180 degree flat, but an inclined S form. Other airlines offer a much better business class for less money, and on my next US flight I will definitely choose another airline if I find out that the airplane has the old seats. Lufthansa tickets in business class are generally high priced. so I would expect 180 degree seats. Service staff though is very well trained, professional and food quality is good.", "air_title": "Lufthansa ", "Customer_name": "Hessing Frank"}
