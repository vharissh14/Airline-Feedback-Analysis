When we boarded the aircraft my wife asked for a glass of champagne while we waited for take-off and the hostess said 'I would have to open another bottle'. She then walked away and did not return. Given the cost of the ticket we would have bought that bottle many, many times over. I like to watch movies, or the map of our progress, and on a flight of over 8 hours this is important to me. You guessed it the video system did not work at all for me, nor for several other customers around me. I did complain and have been offered compensation of \u00a360 but only against the cost of another BA ticket. As far as I am concerned they can keep their voucher as my wife, and I, will not fly BA again - ever.", "air_title": "British Airways ", "Customer_name": "Andrew Tobin"}
