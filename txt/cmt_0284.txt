Overall a very good flight with BA. I had a good window seat with direct aisle access and fortunately the cabin was not particularly busy so the toilet did not cause any disturbance. I find the seat very comfortable for eating, lounging and sleeping, although a mattress topper would make sleeping even more comfortable. The half folding table is great when you just have a drink or your phone charging, but of course this has to become the table when a meal service starts so it is a shame there isn't a separate table. The inflight entertainment is excellent, I do not understand any criticism of this as the screen is large and good quality and there is a large choice of films and TV. The catering however continues to be poor with BA. While the menu sounds great and dishes generally look good, they often fall down when you actually eat them. As this was an overnight flight the meals were designed lighter and the champagne and canap\u00e9s starter sounded perfect, they were however 3 limp tasteless bite sized things. This to me is BA's weakest area and they really need to improve their catering offering in order to compete with other airlines. Service from cabin crew were very good, friendly and efficient and always calling me by my name wherever they see me in the cabin.", "air_title": "British Airways ", "Customer_name": "C Down"}
