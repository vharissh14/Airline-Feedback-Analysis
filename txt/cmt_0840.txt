Nothing to criticize. The seats in economy are a bit narrow - especially if the guest in front of you reclines the seat. The new onboard entertainment system on flight 477 from Vancouver to Munich is nice - as you have your own high quality touch screen with a standard 3.5 in plug for earphones. So your own (noise cancelling) headphones will work. You also get a USB charger on that. In my case the entertainment system did not contain any movies (probably introduced during service before the flight) and i was not able to watch any for the 11 hr flight.", "air_title": "Lufthansa ", "Customer_name": "Bernd Sonderhuesken-Puchtinger"}
