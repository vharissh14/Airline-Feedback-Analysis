Traveled on a leg of a round trip holiday to US from Australia. Pre-flight announcement advised potential problems with the entertainment system on the 777-200, and not fixed by the time we took off. After a number of attempts to reset at the start of the flight, the crew gave up and I endured 13+ hours with nothing to distract while jammed in one of the worst economy class seats (47F). A very unpleasant flight. Even in the 70s you got an inflight movie! Food was much worse than other Air New Zealand legs flown. Staff were good, and full of apologies, but this does not excuse poor maintenance.", "air_title": "Air New Zealand ", "Customer_name": "D Tansell"}
