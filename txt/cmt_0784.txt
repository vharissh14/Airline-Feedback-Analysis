Could not fault the flights I had with them. Service was very good and cabin crew attentive. Travelled with two friends for the Oktoberfest who were both 6ft 6in and I am below 6 ft. Both of my tall friends had no complaints with the legroom. Baggage arrived on time. All in all flights had been hassle-free. Only downside is lack of entertainment but for a short flight it was barely noticeable. Will definitely fly with them again.", "air_title": "Lufthansa ", "Customer_name": "A Palomo"}
