London to Delhi then a domestic flight. Wasn't pleased at all. Entertainment selection was very poor but that didn't concern me much. Seats were okay. Toilets were not as clean and not at all fresh from the very beginning of the flight. Attitude of the crew were as if they wished they didn't have to serve the passengers. Not even once any of them said \"welcome\" or smiled to my \"thank you\" which I said out of habit every time any of them served me. Food was tasteless. Coffee was served cold both times. Trays was cleared much later after passengers were done eating. Some had to get out of their seat to go to the washroom and had to go through some \"acrobatic\" moves to get out of the seat holding up their food tray. Some already fall a sleep before the crew cleared the trays. At breakfast, we were served only with a piece of cake and a small serving of fruits and cold coffee. It looked to me there was an empty space on the tray to serve breakfast item but nothing came. I strongly suspect that either they \"forgot\" to serve it or they were too late to serve the entree so skipped it all together. The time between dinner and breakfast was long on a 8 hours 30 minutes flight. No other snacks / drinks were offered in between. Crew totally ignored the call button and my loud enough \"excuse me\", more than twice. Horrible, terrible customer service. The crew were a disgrace. I am dreading my 9 hours 35 minutes return flight from Mumbai to London on Sunday 1:40am. If I can help it, depending on my schedule, I might not fly Jet Airways again.", "air_title": "Jet Airways ", "Customer_name": "S Chowdhury"}
