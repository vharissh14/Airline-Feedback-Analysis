On 6th January we flew from San Diego to Manchester UK via Heathrow. After flying out on Christmas Day via LAX on the A380 this flight was a welcome return to form for BA's Club World offering. The San Diego Admiral's Club lounge is currently undergoing refurbishment but is still a nice space and unlike the UK lounges upon arrival we were offered a menu, not just a 'self serve' buffet. When it came time to board this was a much smoother experience than our previous flight on the A380, the staff at San Diego had the boarding area well organised and once club passengers were called we were on the aircraft, glass of bubbly in hand in minutes. The cabin crew were much friendlier and professional than those on the outward flight, as this is smaller cabin with fewer passengers you definitely felt that you were the 'premium' customer your ticket price would suggest and nothing was too much trouble. Drinks were constantly topped up, food was excellent and the cabin crew were chatty and friendly. The entertainment system might not have been quite as impressive as on the A380 but considering we slept for a large portion of this 10 hour flight that was unimportant. After a very average outward flight on the A380 into LA this superb flight home on the smaller aircraft restored my faith in BA's club offering and means that for future trips to the West Coast we will be flying direct into San Diego rather than LAX.", "air_title": "British Airways ", "Customer_name": "M Gibson"}
