We had a flight out of Delhi, FLT # 9W7125, at 8.35. We received no phone call of our flight being canceled and arrived at the airport 2 hours before. Apparently they called some passengers, but not all. We then heard it was canceled, after we waited in line. The best they could do was put us on a 2.30 flight. The 2.30 flight came and went, no flight took off. They could not tell us anything, except that it was delayed 1 hour. Then it was delayed again, nobody could tell us the truth. The truth being, the city the flight was originating from was delayed due to weather and had not taken off yet. Why not just tell us that and try to book us on another flight. There was much chaos at the airport and the passengers were in an uproar. Nobody was giving them answers. Finally the plane arrived and we eventually took off at 6.30. This is 10hours after our original flight, we arrived at our final destination at 2am! To top if off, they actually wanted to charge us for meals on the plane, after waiting that long. I see this as the worst customer service ever.", "air_title": "Jet Airways ", "Customer_name": "T Sierra"}
