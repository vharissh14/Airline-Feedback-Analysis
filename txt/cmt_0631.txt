Seat large and very comfortable for 6ft, 100 kg male. Tilt / recline took a couple of attempts yet once learned quite simple. Loved the no recline from seat in front. Legroom was more than enough. Sat in middle seats with partner, more than enough room for a couple. Enjoyed middle armrests as table. Seat most impressive for this class of travel, highly recommended. Entertainment system didn't have a large selection of movies although with so many internet/ on demand systems at home these days I am finding this is the case with many airlines. Service fine although nothing special, ordered drinks from entertainment screen menu always took a while to arrive. Food was fantastic although dessert is served before main. Avoid seats near toilets as a queue often forms. Overall a fantastic way to fly. Would be great if more airlines offered the spaceseat.", "air_title": "Air New Zealand ", "Customer_name": "P Jones"}
