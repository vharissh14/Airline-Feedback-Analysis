On the way there everything went fine. A day before our departure we were told that the flight was overbooked and asked politely to change to a different flight. We were told that they would pay for the taxi (the flight was earlier and no public transport was available.) as well as for the breakfast that we were missing at our hotel. We agreed to change, because we sympathized with BA representative, who had a difficult job of asking people to move to a different flight and because we wanted to support British Airways. Big mistake. Apparently everything we were told by their representative was a lie and no refund for the taxi fare was given to us. So much for doing BA a favor, they are not a reputable company they once were.", "air_title": "British Airways ", "Customer_name": "J Wer"}
