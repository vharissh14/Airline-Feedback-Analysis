We (2) found the flights better than we expected them to be but there are opportunities for improvement. Our seats were reasonably comfortable, all flights were on time, long haul had VOD to keep us entertained but the film choice was a little restricted and old and there seemed to be no resume viewing option (i.e. continue from where you left off). Food was reasonable, the cabin crew on our aisle on the way out were incompetent (those on the adjacent isle knew what they were doing). The meal on the night flight on the way out arrived 2 hours after we took off which was far too late. My major complaint would be that all the cabin crew (bar one) disappeared once the meal had been served and did not appear again until the next meal. No one came around offering water and the toilets were not serviced. Despite all of this, of the cheap budget airlines flying to Delhi (and return), they are not the worst.", "air_title": "Jet Airways ", "Customer_name": "Paul Harvey"}
