Only 2 toilets available for all economy passengers, toilets soon dirty, not cleaned. Uncomfortable seats. As soon as plane landed in Mumbai and still moving fast, seat belts were opened and passengers started pulling bags out of the overhead lockers. Staff's reaction was late and not effective. Then pulling, shoving and pushing to get out of airplane first, window seat passengers elbowing their way past aisle seat passengers, chaos reigned. Never again Jet Airways!", "air_title": "Jet Airways ", "Customer_name": "A Goei"}
