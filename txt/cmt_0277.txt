We paid an extra \u00a3170 to pre-book seats upstairs, which was ridiculously expensive. It's been several years since I last tried BA Club on a transatlantic flight, and I was frankly shocked at how bad the product has become. Compared to the Emirates business class I'd experienced from the far east just 6 weeks before, BA are fast becoming the 'Lada' of the Airline business. The seats are no longer that comfortable, with the window passenger having to step over the feet of the total stranger in the next row to get into the aisle. The entertainment? Really poor! But, worst of all, the food! I would have been disappointed to get rubbish like that served in Economy, but when one has paid thousands of pounds for the privilege? The breakfast was a joke. A glass of orange juice accompanied by a few slices of fruit and melon and the offer of a tiny bacon roll! My wife had requested special vegetarian meals, so when the bacon rolls came along the Cabin Crew first offered her one, then said \"Oh sorry, of course you're vegetarian!\" and that was it - no alternative! Never again BA!", "air_title": "British Airways ", "Customer_name": "Morrison Jack"}
