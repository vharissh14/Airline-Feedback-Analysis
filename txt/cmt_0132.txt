Food and service acceptable, but LHR-BOM and BOM-BKK ran 30-mins late, plus 1-hour delay at BKK-Immigration, meant I was tight for time to make my onward domestic-connection. De-planing in BOM was also very slow, for those of us sitting down the back, how much longer until the terminal building-work is completed? Security-check in BOM on-return took an hour, and that was with Jet-staff pulling us out of the queue, since our onward-flight was closing!", "air_title": "Jet Airways ", "Customer_name": "R Bell"}
