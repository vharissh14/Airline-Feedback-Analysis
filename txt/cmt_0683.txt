Really impressed by the new LH Premium Economy, which I could use for the very first time. Check-in friendly and quick. Boarding efficient. On board a very friendly crew. Once I had taken my seat, welcome drink was offered to all passengers in this section. Nice amenity kit at every seat. The seat is simply great, much more space than in normal Economy, big IFE-screen with huge entertainment options. This was one of the drawbacks of flying Lufthansa but they finally improved it. Meal service from a menu, 3 main dishes to chose from. Well presented on fine china. Due to departure at midnight, service very efficient but never looked stressed. Wanted to give us more time to sleep. The seat is very comfortable, good enough to sleep for 6 hours or so. Of course can't compare with their new Business seats, which are top notch. During the night staff came around with drinks and snacks. Breakfast could have been better in my opinion. But that's the only negative point. In all, Lufthansa is getting a real premium carrier. Staff excellent, efficient, friendly and professional.", "air_title": "Lufthansa ", "Customer_name": "Puneck Holger"}
