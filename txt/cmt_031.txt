We are both registered disabled with mobility problems - at Heathrow check-in we were promised 3 seats in order for us to stretch our legs. On both flights we were given 1 seat each, rows apart with hardly any leg room. The seatbelt light was kept on most of the 1st long-haul flight so we weren't able to stand or use the toilet for hours at a time. The trip back was a dream, the cabin crews were so attentive and on the Delhi to London leg we were both given 4 seats at the back so we could lie down. My advice to anyone with a disability would be to email customer services prior to booking, detailing your needs. To anyone else I'd say Jet Airways isn't too bad considering the reasonable price of flights, if you're a fussy eater and don't like spicy food, take a packed lunch and take a cushion as the seats aren't very comfy.", "air_title": "Jet Airways ", "Customer_name": "S Talbot"}
