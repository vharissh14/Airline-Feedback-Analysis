I arrived at IAD during a bad snowstorm. The gate counter showed the flight as \"on time\" until the 748 showed up, 60m before the scheduled departure time. Departure was then delayed by 90 minutes. The American agents at the gate weren't very polished about it, but not too bad either. They were able to give me my new arrival time in Istanbul (3.5h later than originally planned). We boarded, but needed to de-ice and it took 2.5h between boarding and taking off. I am glad I had had a snack at IAD! The captain was frustrated and very apologetic throughout. This was my 2nd flight on LH 748, and although I love the Queen of the Skies, the 748 economy cabin is not pleasant. It is very chopped up, and you don't have that Wow feel you should have in a 747. I was on the first aisle seat behind the premium economy, which means that the aisle abruptly narrowed, and I was \"in the way.\" Dinner was fine and the choice of entertainment was great. Because of the delay, I had a rushed transfer at FRA, where the passengers needed to take a bus to board (no jetway for the IST flight). The flight to IST, on a spotless A320 was uneventful. Good lunch, but no entertainment at all. All in all, Lufthansa did well, considering the storm. But on my way back, Turkish Airlines and United were just as good if not a little better.", "air_title": "Lufthansa ", "Customer_name": "O Hazan"}
