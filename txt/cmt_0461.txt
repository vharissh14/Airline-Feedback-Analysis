Flight on time. Full plane. Very uncomfortable seats, I am tall, no leg room, knees against the seat in front for the flight of over 5 hrs. This is the wrong plane for this trip-narrow single aisle, only 2 toilets for all 180 passengers - more like a bucket and spade flight. Food very moderate, salad starter of 3 leaves and an uncut chunk of cucumber, main course of chicken and potato was tepid, not hot at all. Cabin crew spent a lot of the time chatting in the galley at the back of the plane, although the food service was quick. Upgraded on the outward trip-what a difference! BA needs to sort the plane choice out-this flight is often completely full. Economy was very poor.", "air_title": "British Airways ", "Customer_name": "D Taylor"}
