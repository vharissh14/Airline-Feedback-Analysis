Advance online seat reservation was not working, but able to get an aisle during online checkin - which opened earlier than the advertised 23 hours before the flight, so most good seats were gone. Seats are very cramped - 31 inch pitch is too small for a long-limbed 6 footer like me. Entertainment system was awful - screen far too close, painfully slow, the films were old and music content limited, audio barely audible. On the plus side, staff were excellent.", "air_title": "Lufthansa ", "Customer_name": "C Currie"}
