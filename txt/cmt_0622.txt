Brilliant service on this airline. Love the way they employ mature flight attendants, who are so friendly, courteous and helpful. Seat folding to flat bed for transpacific flight was wonderfully comfortable. Food was (mostly) delicious, with some exceptions.", "air_title": "Air New Zealand ", "Customer_name": "Greg Bell"}
