Flight left late but made it perfectly on time. I always fly this route with Turkish Airlines in Comfort class (Premium Economy) but this time I decided to give Lufthansa and its new product a try. Seat: absolutely adequate and wide enough. There is plenty of room for your legs. It is ok for getting some sleep. I liked the amenity kit distributed. What I really did not like it's the absolute absence of privacy as the Premium Economy seats are actually not separated in any way from regular Economy class. Very good (and upgraded) IFE. The welcome drink, despite very basic (juice) is a nice touch. Cabin crew, as always with Lufthansa, is efficient, similing and polite. But let me spend some words on the food: almost inedible. It is actually the same food you would get in Economy class, but served in china plates. Portion are getting every time smaller and food is almost tasteless. The price paid was quite high - overall, not the best value for money. I'm afraid Lufthansa lost me on this route as I will keep flying Turkish Airlines Comfort class. Generally speaking, Lufthansa remains a reliable airline.", "air_title": "Lufthansa ", "Customer_name": "F Bertoni"}
