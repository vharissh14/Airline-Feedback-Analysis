We haven't flown BA for sometime, and to be honest we have no desire to fly with BA again anytime soon. The plane was an Airbus 320 and was just like a bus. Uncomfortable hard, very upright seats, not even sure you can recline them. We sat in row 11 and on both outward and inbound flights the cabin temperature was far to hot and stuffy, although it seemed to be an issue in just 4 rows as the front and back of the plane was much cooler. We both came off the return flight with bad headaches. The food was simply awful, thank goodness we ate a proper breakfast before boarding as the minuscule roll and wrap was hardly enough to feed a child, and on that topic the food was not suitable for a young toddler and there was no child option. The service was ok, nothing to complain about, very matter of fact and despite the previous comments the plane was clean etc. We flew the same route in October last year with a UK holiday airline and that was all round far more superior.", "air_title": "British Airways ", "Customer_name": "W Harris"}
