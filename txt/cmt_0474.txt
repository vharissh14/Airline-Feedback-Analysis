Club World cabin. Wife and I have flown business class on - Singapore, Air New Zealand, Emirates, Air Malaysia and Virgin, on 20 occasions to New Zealand by various routes, so we are familiar with the service provided at this level by other airlines. BA, in our opinion, doesn't come close. Briefly: - being charged \u00a3284 extra to reserve seats, how do they get away with it? Personally we felt uncomfortable with the back-to-front seat layout, too enclosed and awkward to get out of, (we were in the inner cell) and I would imagine irritating for the outside passengers as well to have people clambering over their legs. Details - \"hot towels\" threadbare, scraps of cloth that were stone cold in under ten seconds, and then only one and nothing for morning wake-up, cheap looking menus, lukewarm tea and coffee thrust over the barrier in mugs, a sudden rattle as the screen was lowered and a basket of bread rolls thrust under your nose, having to reach out sideways to receive meals, embarrassment at disturbing the outside passenger trays passed over them, minute napkins, (expect paper sheets anytime soon) cabin crew just doing their job, walking up and down the aisles at great speeds so as to avoid being asked for something, cold soggy croissants which are an insult to croissants, and don't get me started about the bacon roll! We were offered a drink before dinner and had to ask for a top-up, one glass of wine with dinner (dry tough steak) and a refill after we had finished eating, no after dinner drinks were offered. Lights out-see you in the morning! I could go on, but suffice to say we are so disappointed that our national airline could be so far behind the others.", "air_title": "British Airways ", "Customer_name": "Paul le Grys"}
