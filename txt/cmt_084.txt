Upon checking in Mumbai, for our continuing international flight, we found out that we did not have any excess weight! We recommend checking with another agent if you are asked to pay for excess weight. No food on this short flight, we did get a voucher for a light meal - it was a small box full with junk food, inedible. They do offer wraps vegetarian or chicken for purchase on the plane, very average quality.", "air_title": "Jet Airways ", "Customer_name": "Bawnik Odelia"}
