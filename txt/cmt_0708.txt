Initial flight was supposed to be a day earlier so I missed my connection in FRA and was put on a Lufthansa flight to Delhi rather than Air India which was nice. VCE-FRA was delayed by 2,hours and I only managed to make it because FRA-DEL was also delayed. FRA airport, although I was there for less than an hour, was an atrocious experience. I had to speed like crazy to make the flight and still had to go through security one more time and they were extremely rude, unprofessional and in no way understanding. This is surely not Lufthansa's fault but it did ruin my trip. Flight to Delhi was on their A380, which I adore. Leg room was fair, food was decent although they only had vegetarian options. FAs were extremely polite and professional and always asked if we wanted any drinks throughout the flight. My issue was mostly related to IFE which was not what I expected from LH. Overly German focused and pretty dull overall. Regardless I surely would fly them again.", "air_title": "Lufthansa ", "Customer_name": "M Riccardo"}
