The return flight had a horrible selection of movies and TV. The food on both flights was abysmal. There is nothing I can really order to eat that suits my dietary requirements so I chose vegetarian as a last resort. Horrible choice. Will have to bring my own food in future, but shouldn't I get a discount for not being provided with a meal?", "air_title": "Air New Zealand ", "Customer_name": "Colleen Johnson"}
