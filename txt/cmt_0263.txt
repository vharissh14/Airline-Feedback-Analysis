The seats were uncomfortable, blankets were of poor quality. Seats were crammed too close to one another, the pillow provided was also of poor quality. The entertainment system was great for TV shows but terrible for movies, only one headphone worked and occasionally the sound would black out, the system suffered a few malfunctions but smoothed out once up in the air. The food was delicious, but the tea and coffee was poor. Staff service was good but still lots of room for improvement. The aircraft and the experience itself seemed old and dated compared to other carriers I have flown with.", "air_title": "British Airways ", "Customer_name": "Kayleigh Collins"}
