A bit delayed due to late arrival of the aircraft from Munich, however the delay was almost made up in Munich, what allowed me to catch the connecting flight. Appreciate the upgrade to Business Class, as Gold Star Alliance member - service great as usual, no any problems. Recommend LH for long haul flights - even in the Economy Class the seat is quite comfortable, and passenger safety and satisfaction is always of top priority.", "air_title": "Lufthansa ", "Customer_name": "Simon Aleksander"}
