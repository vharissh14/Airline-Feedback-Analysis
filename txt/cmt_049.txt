I have flown to Europe on KLM, BA and Air France so I am comparing my experience with these airlines rather than other Asia carriers. Price - The price to Brussels on Jet Airways was about 20% cheaper than the Business Class fares on the carriers mentioned above that would have met my itinerary requirements. I usually book 2-3 months in advance and keep an eye out for seat sales etc. Lounge - At Pearson, Jet Airways is in Terminal 1 and shares the lounge with Air Canada. In Brussels they have their own lounge which caters more to the Indian taste. (Not that I mind, I enjoyed chicken wasabi sandwiches). Priority Services - The priority boarding has improved since my last trip in November, especially on the Brussels site. I had no trouble accessing the gate agent and boarding the plane. InFlight - The inflight service is very well done, the meals tasty, a good selection of entertainment and fully flat sears for sleeping, with sheets and comforter. Comparison to other carriers - I would say that other than price, each one of the other carriers I have flown are better in one respect but not the others. Jet Airways is number 2 in all the categories for me which makes it an all around good experience and is why as long as they are the same price or cheaper I will fly them over the other choices. (BA has the best seat, but the worst food, the worst airport to transit, ok service - Air France has the best food, but I don't like the seats, KLM usually has the best service, but the worst seats).", "air_title": "Jet Airways ", "Customer_name": "Michael Dielissen"}
