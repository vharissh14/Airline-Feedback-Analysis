Airbus A320, SYD - Auckland a joke, cramped and ridiculous should not be used for a 3.5 hour journey, Auckland to YVR on 777-200ER, different story, plane showing age however was quite comfortable, selected vegetarian option, surprisingly good, did the reverse journey leaving YVR 28th May, again 777-200 ER YVR to Auckland and a much better option 767-300 Auckland to Sydney, service efficient. If 777-200ER seating configuration changes to a 3-4-3 as envisaged, I definitely would not travel on Air New Zealand, management should be forced to endure these cramped seats for 12-14 hours and see way at it feels like.", "air_title": "Air New Zealand ", "Customer_name": "R DuPreez"}
