Outbound left almost on time, excellent considering a full large aircraft. Food and drinks service speedy, an improvement on a year ago when the A380 entered service and lunch took 3 hours start to end! Opted for lower deck front row middle two seats -perfect for friends, not so much for strangers. Prefer lower deck on outbound due to the middle seats and high ceilings / wide aisles. Feels very spacious. Arrival at LAX improved and staff were very pro active in splitting ESTA and non and passengers and getting people through as quickly as possible. Return flight outstanding. First lounge not yet open, however used Business Lounge and was quiet with excellent service. Priority boarding and walked to seat. CSM introduced himself and explained that only 8 out 14 seats booked (rarity on this route) and as such had two seats each! Middle seats for dining and sleeping, then moved back to windows for breakfast and landing. Food and service very attentive \u0096 never a wait for anything, had to start turning down drinks. Washbags had not been loaded at Heathrow and sleeping suit size not available, but given Club washbag and as a gesture the crew gave a bottle of Grand Siecle to take away \u0096 worth far more than a couple of wash bags! Could not fault the three cabin crew serving, landed on time and bags were at carousel before us. Can't wait to fly First to Singapore next year and compare the A380 service.", "air_title": "British Airways ", "Customer_name": "M Sears"}
