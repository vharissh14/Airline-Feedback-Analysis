Very pleased with the service and smiles. Friendly staff. All are short-haul so no entertainment. There were one or two flights with proper meals, but the others only had snacks and drink. The food was all right as they are very short. The seats were hard but has okay comfort level. Some times check-in get a little confusing for the crew but that's my own problem as I transferred a lot. Pretty satisfied overall!", "air_title": "Lufthansa ", "Customer_name": "C Yiyi"}
