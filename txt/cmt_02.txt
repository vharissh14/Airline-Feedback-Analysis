For economy the food was great and tasty. They provided chicken filled pastries which were nice in between the main meals and lots to drink. Beer, whiskey, coke. The crew was very nice and generous. Tickets are a bit pricey at times, but it's worth it. The newer A330-300's are very nice and are new/modern. Will fly with them again!", "air_title": "Jet Airways ", "Customer_name": "A Bakshi"}
