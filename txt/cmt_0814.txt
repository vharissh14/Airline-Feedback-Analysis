I had a very nice flight. The seats were comfortable, the food was tasty, the service was friendly, and overall I was quite pleased. My only complaint was that the plane was very cold. Also, the flight was quite expensive. However, I am usually willing to pay a bit more for a Lufthansa flight. The inflight entertainment system was having some trouble as well. It was very very slow.", "air_title": "Lufthansa ", "Customer_name": "Sara Kreil"}
