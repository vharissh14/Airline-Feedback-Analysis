Crew were pleasant on both the flights especially that onwards to RIX. They were lively, willing to help and didn't mind making small talk with passengers. Like all LH flights, even this one was refitted with Recaro seats and ceiling attached TV. Passengers were served muesli bars on first leg and on the second leg, yoghurt dip with freshly chopped fruits - this is what disappoints me as LH takes pride in being full service airline. Previously they at least served freshly baked bread rolls and sandwiches. LH should really reconsider on snacks they serve as I believe 120 mins are enough to serve a proper small meal although the crew is saving grace and made several drink rounds. I have travelled extensively on different airlines and wouldn't hesitate to suggest LH to up their game.", "air_title": "Lufthansa ", "Customer_name": "V Ladhani"}
