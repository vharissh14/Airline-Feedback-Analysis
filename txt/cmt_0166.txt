The IFE had to be re-booted and the system was not yet up to date like on other BA aircraft. The seating cover on my Club World seat kept coming off, the aircraft seemed very tired. The food again was at a good standard and the crew were helpful. I always fly BA and I love the Boeing 747 but unfortunately the 747 have to go at some point.", "air_title": "British Airways ", "Customer_name": "Richard Lightbody"}
