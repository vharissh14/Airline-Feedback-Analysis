The flight to Mumbai was decent but on the way back I was a little taken aback by the service. There were flight attendants shouting at people and when I asked for water I was told very rudely to wait. Mumbai airport was an utter nightmare with men and women searched and separated upon landing, not to mention the mosquitoes which were everywhere. I would highly recommend flying via Delhi which we did on the return and it was a more pleasurable experience. Seats were large enough otherwise and food was alright. Would not recommend unless you have a very cheap ticket.", "air_title": "Jet Airways ", "Customer_name": "Mark Perera"}
