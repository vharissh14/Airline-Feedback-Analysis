Club Kitchen snacks are shrinking with little left half way through long flights and meals, and choice less. Although there are many new business class seats out there that are better BA is still acceptable, especially the very private window seats. Crew usually excellent, and baggage delivery consistent at terminal 5. My one complaint over these 6 flights would be that no effort is made to control, the amount of hand baggage on board, even on short flights boarding takes so long while stressed crew are trying to find space for large and heavy bags when some people have two or three large bags each. Two out of six flights were delayed because of this while they offloaded some bags that would not fit. Recent flights with Easyjet have not had this problem, they enforce their rules so we all know where we stand.", "air_title": "British Airways ", "Customer_name": "Mark Freyton"}
