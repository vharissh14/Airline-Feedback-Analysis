Lufthansa provided excellent value, a very pleasant flight experience and great professional staff from pilots to cabin crew! It is always a pleasure to fly with Lufthansa because their crew really values you and gives you the best flight experience possible. The cabin crew were very responsive. The seats were comfortable. There is none of the nickel-and-diming miserliness other airlines seem to specialize in. The service is prompt, courteous, and generous!", "air_title": "Lufthansa ", "Customer_name": "Lutz Reinhart"}
