We were delighted about this, however we soon wished we had stayed in Premium Economy as the cabin crew were extremely unfriendly and gave the impression that it was beneath them to attend to us. They rushed the meal service and hardly spoke to anyone, and as for a smile forget it! The only upside to the upgrade was the lie flat bed , I am pleased that we didn't pay full price for this appalling service. Next time we will be staying in Premium Economy which was excellent.", "air_title": "Air New Zealand ", "Customer_name": "K Dobson"}
