On the positive side of LH415, I would like to mention that they managed to transfer my luggage although United co-chair LH9295 was extremely late. The seats on LH415 can, however, only be rated as less than adequate. LH does not yet offer any form of economy plus. The seat are both rather narrow (8 lines of seats in an A330!) and the spacing between them is completely insufficient for tall people. I will not fly this airplane in this configuration anymore. The provision of classical music is mostly absent.", "air_title": "Lufthansa ", "Customer_name": "Christoph G\u00fcnther"}
