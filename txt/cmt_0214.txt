Seats 5a and 5k. This was my first time in BA first and I was really impressed. From the moment my boyfriend and I walked up to check in, to the moment we left the plane we were very well looked after. The food was nice and particularly enjoyed the \"buddy dining\". My gooseberry crumble went down well. I got around 2 hours sleep as the jet stream and storm that was hitting the North Eastern U.S made our flight very bumpy but also super fast. Flying time being little over 7 hours 20 mins. I must mention the cabin crew, who were very helpful and professional. We bought the seats in the sale and it was money well spent.", "air_title": "British Airways ", "Customer_name": "J Clark"}
