Flight delayed by almost an hour despite being informed in the lounge that everything was on time, reason provided by Captain was late inbound aircraft. (this was my third late running BA flight in as many weeks). No apologies other than the rather matter of fact explanation from the flight deck, surly cabin crew who clearly wanted to be somewhere else other than looking after their guests on board. I have two more flights in the coming month with BA, rather regretting having booked with this carrier now.", "air_title": "British Airways ", "Customer_name": "Ian Sinclair"}
