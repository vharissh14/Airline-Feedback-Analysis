Lufthansa offers very good European product. Both flights arrived on time and Lufthansa provides nice clean aircraft's with very friendly cabin crew. I am very much pleased with the generous leg room in comparison with low cost companies. This is very much appreciated! In terms of the food, I have only one comment since Lufthansa gives sandwiches which used to be very tasty. Now, they gave us the cheese sandwich which was full of unidentified cream and mayonnaise. It was so stodgy and unpleasant. I hope that the management will make appropriate actions to distribute healthy simple food in the future. Overall, Lufthansa is my first choice and it is recommended without hesitation for European routes.", "air_title": "Lufthansa ", "Customer_name": "M Tushishvili"}
