Self service check in, bag drop, security, boarding all uneventful. Seat comfortable enough and FAs smiling, friendly, seemingly enjoying themselves. We were offered tea, coffee or water and choice of a (yes, one) biscuit or a little bag of cassava chippies. I don't mind if Air NZ wants to be cheap or save money but I'd like the option to get something a bit better than that, even if I have to pay. Some years ago, I regularly flew with Air NZ WLG-AKL and they used to provide a full cooked breakfast and substantial snacks during the rest of the day . Disappointed with the change. Toilet was spotless but nothing else was. Bulkheads, arm rest, seat back, seat, all filthy. Noting has been dusted for an age, let alone wiped down. Gross. We hit turbulence en route and gratefully, the pilot managed to drop us down below it. Baggage misdirected at CHC, so took almost an hour to retrieve it. Ground staff were aware of this but surprisingly, didn't bother to tell anyone, we had to go find them. Little competition appears to not have done anyone any favours and so will have to fly them again. Oh well. Word of caution...Always use the NZ website to book flights. When Iwent to book my multi drop NZ itinerary on their UK website, only the full fat (most expensive) fare was offered. I switched to the NZ site and saved several hundred dollars.", "air_title": "Air New Zealand ", "Customer_name": "Mark Williams"}
