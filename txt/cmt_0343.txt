Travelled NRT-LHR and return (BA5/BA6) on B777 in CW. Seats are designed in an S shape. This means that half the passengers fly backwards! Seats lie flat but a foot rest has to released from the wall to put your feet/legs on. Width of seats is poor and I found the seating cramped. Service was excellent both ways, food good with plenty of drinks and snacks on offer. Very hard to get to storage bin to put your stuff into. One small gripe, a 12 hour flight needs more than one meal and a light \"breakfast\". Lounge in Narita good standard, but in Heathrow very basic.", "air_title": "British Airways ", "Customer_name": "G Brown"}
