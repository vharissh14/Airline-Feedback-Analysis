I was disappointed that, due to BA changing the aircraft, the seat in the exit row that I booked and paid extra for was not available and they had failed to inform me. The seat allocated on the Boeing was quite cramped for my frame and I was not that comfortable. I had tried to get this changed before the flight on line but all I got was a request to phone BA after the flight. There must have been other passengers affected in this change. That said, the flight left on time and the proffered cheese croissant and coffee were fine. Staff attentive and pleasant. The return on 22nd was the 16.35 departure which again was punctual and my seat choice was as I had requested. The snack was fine and the small bottle of Pinotage was pleasant enough. Due to turbulence about which we had been kept informed by frequent announcements by the first officer and captain, the ride was a bit bumpy for half an hour or so. I think that BA needs to update some of these old dinosaurs and invest in new planes like Easyjet and Ryanair seem to be able to do. However, by booking early I got a great price, decent luggage allowance and a snack so I can't complain. I also like the ability to carry on a laptop as well as a cabin bag, avoiding some of the boarding horror stories associated with the budget airlines. I do like to \"fly the flag\" and shall continue to do so but a bit of investment in new planes would be nice.", "air_title": "British Airways ", "Customer_name": "Driscoll Peter"}
