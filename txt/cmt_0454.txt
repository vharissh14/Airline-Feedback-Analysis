The aircraft was impressive. It was quiet and comfortable. The lower altitude cabin and the higher humidity were not noticeable in flight, but the lack of jetlag was noticeable. Service was very good. The business cabin was 2/3 empty. The cabin crew were very attentive. The negatives was the seating and entertainment system. With the large windows, the rear facing seats were a poor design. The feeling of closeness was uncomfortable. I guess the extra seat they squeeze in makes it all worth while to the airline. The amount of choices in all the video selection and the content left a lot to be desired. Return was in a 777. The seating and entertainment were the same, This and the A380 use to be my favorite airplane. However the 787 has become favorite airplane now. I think it is the last time I will fly BA Business class until they change their seating.", "air_title": "British Airways ", "Customer_name": "Burke Tom"}
