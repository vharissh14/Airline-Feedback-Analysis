On domestic routes, it's a no brainer. Main routes are serviced by almost brand new A320s and the rest by fairly new Q300's and ATR 72's. All crew members (like all kiwis) are very polite and helpful. Only downside is very basic food/beverage service (coffee/tea + water + cookie) on domestic flights. Long haul not so flash compared to eg Singapore Airlines or Emirates, but still decent standard. Heaps of discounted domestic flights if you buy in advance.", "air_title": "Air New Zealand ", "Customer_name": "Petr Polivka"}
