Had the aisle bulkhead in the front of economy. LOTS of legroom, though the IFE and tray are both in the armrest (fine by me). Seat was very comfortable and I slept well. Crew were excellent, as was the food. Got to watch 2 recent Oscar winning films in the IFE. I love the A340's having the economy class toilets downstairs. Wish LH flew directly to New Zealand: they would have my money every time.", "air_title": "Lufthansa ", "Customer_name": "J Egan"}
