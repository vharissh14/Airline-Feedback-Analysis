Our choice was to fly with a free bag each and we were initially given the very worst seats on the aircraft, the two right at the back by the toilets. Only Air New Zealand charges $30 to choose a seat, so the upgrade was appreciated. However during the meal I was told my choice was no available and that as an upgrade I did not count. I was offered the choice of two other meals but did not want either of them and settled for another starter. Flying this airline is not what it was, it used to be a great experience, now the on board staff don't really care what happens. This was once a pleasure to fly but now it is a relief to get off the plane and really nowadays we only fly with them for the points and they are very careful to book you on a non points earning ticket. Small wonder they are making a profit.", "air_title": "Air New Zealand ", "Customer_name": "Nield Brian"}
