Good experience on all legs. Staff seemed slightly more attentive on outward trip but differences were minor. All flights on time, lie flats bed comfortable, food good and enjoyed the wine selection. IFE did not carry a particularly large selection of latest movies (unless Bollywood) and overall options of classics not great. No seat entertainment on Mumbai to Bangkok leg and seating slightly dated although comfortable. Good value for business class compared with other airlines and only a slight inconvenience going via India. Also arrival at LHR quickest ever and through terminal with bags in just over 10 minutes. Would certainly use again without hesitation.", "air_title": "Jet Airways ", "Customer_name": "Rich Simpkinson"}
