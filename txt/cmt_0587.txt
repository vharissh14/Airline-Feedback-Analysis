The food, drink, and service was substantially better than Economy with Air NZ, which was excellent, as I would rate Air NZ economy service highly. Great selection of modern movies and shows with IFE. The seat, while dated, was sufficiently comfortable for my 6'3 build. However people who have a slightly larger girth may struggle with the seat. Moving past another passenger from the window seat was also a tricky situation. However overall a very pleasant experience, would certainly recommend.", "air_title": "Air New Zealand ", "Customer_name": "F Pearce"}
