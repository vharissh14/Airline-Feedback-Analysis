On the whole - their staff on the ground are polite and well informed. Positives for this flight - good lounge in Singapore - the food has improved, but it can be crowded. Club class cabins seem fairly spacious - (I was upstairs) but not as good as the 747. Excellent bathrooms - really spacious. One member of the flight crew was excellent and worthy of a gold star for maintaining good humour and excellent service Larger film selection than on the 747 Negatives - The food - awful - they've reduced the menu choices and the beef was inedible. Staff - apart from the member of the flight crew above the others were surly, and uncaring - they are the face of the airline and could be so much better. I will fly with them again but would like the staff to be pushed on politeness and courtesy.", "air_title": "British Airways ", "Customer_name": "D von Bergen"}
