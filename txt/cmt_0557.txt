My flight was delayed 30 minutes, but still arrived in Tokyo on time. The seat was quite cramped and uncomfortable even though I'm not a tall person. Meals were average and not enough for me. One plus point is that the ice cream was tasty. The entertaining programmes were very limited and picture quality of my TV screen was not good. Flight attendants were friendly enough. Honestly I expected more from a 4-star airline like Air New Zealand.", "air_title": "Air New Zealand ", "Customer_name": "Mark Do"}
