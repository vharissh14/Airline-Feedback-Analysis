Although these seats are the old style recliner type, they were comfortable enough for the 4 hour flight. Cabin staff were excellent. Had the bacon roll for breakfast, great taste. Flew back a week later in economy on an Airbus. As always, flying Air NZ is a great experience.", "air_title": "Air New Zealand ", "Customer_name": "Siebers Robert"}
