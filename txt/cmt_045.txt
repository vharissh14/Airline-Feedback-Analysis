Online check-in was not possible, service at the check in desk was OK but by the time we boarded one of our seats was broken and did not recline. The flight attendants did nothing to make up for this. After the return flight some luggage was lost, and after calling the office at Brussels airport for 2 days I received an email address from them. It has been 2 months and I am still waiting for a reply. I am appalled by the lack of quality in their customer service.", "air_title": "Jet Airways ", "Customer_name": "M van der Vaart"}
