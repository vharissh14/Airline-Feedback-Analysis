Another excellent flight with Air New Zealand. The cabin crew were great and made the flight very enjoyable. Food was great and nicely presented. The aircraft was fairly old, but was clean and everything worked as it should. The entertainment system could do with an upgrade, to content, performance and display quality. The Air Canada Maple Leaf Lounge at Vancouver that Air New Zealand uses is quite poor.", "air_title": "Air New Zealand ", "Customer_name": "Tangye Graeme"}
