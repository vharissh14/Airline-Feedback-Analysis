Apart from the extra leg room we were disappointed. The seats were not very comfortable, we did not have separate arm rests, which was a big problem when a large person spilled over one for the entire return journey. The in- flight entertainment TV was old and malfunctioning to the extent that we gave up trying to watch certain movies. The food and service was good for us, but not good for some who had no food choice when certain meals ran out. The staff were on the whole pleasant and helpful, and apologetic about the seating and entertainment equipment. Overall we rated the experience a hardly worth the extra cost, and would rate it as 5 out of 10. Disappointing for us as we have always previously enjoyed travelling with Air New Zealand.", "air_title": "Air New Zealand ", "Customer_name": "C A Burns"}
