The trip started with a two hour stay at Lufthansa's First Class Terminal in Frankfurt. Not only is the environment unique. There are dedicated security check and passport control facilities at this terminal which make travelling much more pleasant. Passengers are transferred by Limo from the First Class Terminal to the plane. The First Class arrangement on the upper deck of the Boeing 744 with a seat and a permanent bed for each passenger is unique and gives you a lot of personal space and privacy. The food was excellent and very well presented. Service by the cabin crew was attentive but not intrusive.", "air_title": "Lufthansa ", "Customer_name": "Hoehler Gerhard"}
