The aircraft (with the exception of NZ 135 seriously needs refurbishing, the seats were hard and very cramped for long haul travel, the IFE was terrible , the picture quality was poor to say the least and because there are no inflight magazines it took some time and patience to navigate. As experienced travellers, one could only say that the food was as bad as it gets and if you want water after meal service you have to go look for someone to serve you. It would be nice if Air NZ would get into the current technology century and provide USB chargers in every seat, not just in Business Class as were informed mid fight. Don't fall for the trap of paying extra for preferred seating, unless you can fluke an exit row or bulkhead seat this is just a money grabber for the airline.", "air_title": "Air New Zealand ", "Customer_name": "Downes John"}
