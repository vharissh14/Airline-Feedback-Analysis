From our previous flights to this destination we knew already that there was not very much to expect. Old 777 plane. Loud, tired staff not really interested, just working on automatic. The seats were old, dirty and shabby looking. No space, cold and freezing on the legs. The very old screens in the seats are just a nightmare to watch. Broken sound systems. The food topped the whole experience. Just awful! Full of preservatives. Very degrading - even when you sit in the so called \"wooden Class\". Over the last 3 years I have been flying to Tampa nothing has been changed by BA.", "air_title": "British Airways ", "Customer_name": "Volker Kubillus"}
