You get what you expect. The weak point is the seating of NEK, as its an Economy Class Seat with the middle-Seat blocked. Seat pitch and space are not luxury, the recline is ridiculous and it feels somewhat cheap. There is no IFE and no power socket, what was not so important on this 110 minutes flight. Nevertheless, I would spend the money again, as the rest was really ok.", "air_title": "Lufthansa ", "Customer_name": "N Rieskamp"}
