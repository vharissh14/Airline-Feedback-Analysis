Out in economy and return in economy plus, both in a 747-400. Outbound, seating was in the V2 configuration meaning that no exit seats were available but did manage a bulkhead seat which made the journey more pleasant. Staff on this flight were quite poor, forgot to serve me dinner and disregarded the call button, literally had to physically stop the steward in the aisle to get service. Return in PE cost an extra \u00a3240 which is quite steep but the dinner was better as was the space and seat. Service on return was excellent. Breakfast really disappointing, cereal bar and a bag of dried fruit, who on earth in management in BA came up with this menu?", "air_title": "British Airways ", "Customer_name": "H Lowe"}
