Both international flights were just average. Little things like lack of in-flight magazine, plastic cutlery, minimal updates from the flight deck and lack of menu bugged me. The service on the old and tired 767 was significantly lower than that on the 787. The touch screen on the 767 was not very responsive at all. I was very impressed with the in-seat bar service on the 787. At the touch of a button you could order a drink or snack from the comfort of your seat and it would be served to you within minutes. The international check in at Auckland Airport was a complete shambles with queues everywhere and a lack of order. I also don't understand why you can't check in online if you booked through a 3rd party travel agent. All other airlines allow this, why not Air New Zealand? The domestic flight was excellent. For just a short 45 min flight we were treated very well with excellent service (cheese and biscuits, wine and soft drinks). The pilots also kept us fully informed on the progress of the flight. All in all Air New Zealand is fine but the international service needs improving. I guess I was just expecting something more from the so called Kiwi hospitality.", "air_title": "Air New Zealand ", "Customer_name": "Glenn Standish"}
