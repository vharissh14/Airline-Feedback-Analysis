Food: It would be great to have the availability of both food choices when sitting at the back of the plane. I'm sure the person sitting in the first rows of economy class didn't pay more than the person in the back and should have the availability to choose between foods. Seat Comfort: The seatmap shown during the self check-in was not the same as found on the plane. In the seatmap during check-in it was shown that there was no other seat to my right. I ended up sitting in the middle seat.", "air_title": "Lufthansa ", "Customer_name": "Igor Popovic"}
