This is fantastic option to increase the number of destinations that you can fly too. However, after a recent experience I was disappointed to discover that some code share options with Air NZ have concealed conditions that are not in line with what you normally expect from an Air NZ flight. From the check in, to the amount of baggage to the inflight entertainment - nothing in this case. Yes this is the Virgin Australia and Air NZ code share agreement. The Works is far from 'The Works' that you would receive on an Air NZ plane. Yes good bye unlimited drinks, hello one drink. Good by movies, hello you can rent one if you would like. I maybe misreading what the works means but to me that generally means everything not a limited sub-par arrangement that they currently have with Virgin. Additionally not being able to fly different classes from Wellington in very frustrating and frankly a missed opportunity for Air NZ.", "air_title": "Air New Zealand ", "Customer_name": "E Chapman"}
