Staff at Muscat were excellent, and could not have been more helpful to my wife (who is a wheelchair user). Catering on the flight was awful. Food was inedible, and we were only served two drinks over an 11hr flight. On arrival, the staff seemed to not know that she was a wheelchair user (despite having assistance booked in advance) which meant a stressful wait on the plane while here wheelchair was found and a lift ordered. We flew out on Oman air that was faster, cheaper, more comfortable, had decent food and better informed staff.", "air_title": "British Airways ", "Customer_name": "J Crane"}
