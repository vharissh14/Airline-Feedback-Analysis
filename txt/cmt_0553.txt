This flight was delayed due to mechanical problems and then cancelled. We were offered hotel accommodation an hours drive from the airport, but at 12.30am the bus transport to the hotel had not arrived and was in some doubt. I then checked with ground staff and was told that we could obtain compensation for an SFO airport hotel, by claiming online. We then checked back into the airport Hyatt Regency where we had been staying and were in bed by 1.20am, unlike those who waited for the bus They got to bed after 3.00am. (They had to be up for the 5am bus back to the airport). When we finally arrived home I contacted Air New Zealand online and was advised to contact their customer relations team. This I did, my requests for information go unanswered. The aircraft for the cancelled flight was an ancient 747. The aircraft that replaced it was also an ancient 747. The replacement aircraft had cabin lights that flickered along with flickering on the video screen. We were told the first aircraft had an electrical problem that prevented it from starting.", "air_title": "Air New Zealand ", "Customer_name": "Trevor Thomson"}
