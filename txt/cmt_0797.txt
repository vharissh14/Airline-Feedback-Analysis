Big confusion at the airport being sent from station to station 4 times before we finally got to ticket agent, than we waited 4 hours to get new flight out of Germany for next morning! Frankfurt to Dusseldorf to Chicago and again delay of 40 minutes and almost missed Chicago flight again, thank goodness the airport is small as we got on the plane at the last minute. Airbus is definitely more comfortable than the Boeing 747 - not enough leg room even for someone 5 ft 5, seats too narrow - misery for 9 hours. Staff very nice and pleasant.", "air_title": "Lufthansa ", "Customer_name": "Natalia Massingill"}
