After reading reviews suggesting that the seats in World Traveller were small and uncomfortable I was not looking forward to this long haul flight. All I can say is these seats are the most comfortable I have ever sat/ slept on. The cabin was quiet with excellent cabin crew. My only complaint is you have to know how to work the system to get the seats with extra legroom or upstairs!", "air_title": "British Airways ", "Customer_name": "Cathy Collison"}
