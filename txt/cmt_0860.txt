I went from Cologne Central Station to Frankfurt Airport Station by AIRail and flew from Frankfurt Airport to Seoul Incheon. The train ride was fast and convenient as well as the check-in at the train station at Frankfurt Airport. No queuing necessary so the transfer time of around 2 hours was almost too long since security checks were not crowded. The flight left on time and arrived 30 minutes early. The service was excellent, the cabin very modern (new 747-8) and the inflight entertainment offered a lot of variety of current movies and TV shows. Another benefit is that the train ride from Cologne to Frankfurt is rewarded with Miles too. All in all, it was an excellent flight experience and I definitely recommend flying Lufthansa.", "air_title": "Lufthansa ", "Customer_name": "S Hoffmann"}
