Flight was scheduled to depart at 8.45 pm on June 30th but took off at 6pm on July 1. I travelled on the Delhi-London-Delhi sector and was shocked at the poor service provided by Jet Airways. The flight was over booked and late. Then finally we all boarded (there was no signage for where to board for the economy class passengers) amidst some confusion. The Captain then announced that there was a technical error and it would soon be fixed. This continued for over four hours until we were finally deplaned at 1 am. In this interim we were served dinner. The crew was not available or responding to any call bells for water etc. They just kept ignoring all passengers, even the elderly and those with children. After we were deplaned the nightmare continued. It took two hours for the ground staff to arrange hotel accommodation and in the interim they refused to tell us which hotels etc. We were expected to empathise with them! Clearly they were unprepared and had not thought ahead to plan for such a situation. We lost a night and a full working day as well. Terrible experience and the worst was the attitude of Jet Airways.", "air_title": "Jet Airways ", "Customer_name": "M Passi"}
