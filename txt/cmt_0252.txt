Lovely newish plane and very attentive staff with smiles. Seat was rear facing and perfectly fine as a bed but seems to have got a little narrower. Window seat 13A and was expecting some sort of decent storage space but only a tiny little sliding drawer, meaning I had to put everything above in the locker and bother the person in 13B. Food and drink was very good as was inflight entertainment. Decent sleep in a comfortable cabin - only real niggle was the 8 abreast cabin which seems inferior to Cathay / Virgin \"herringbone\" design.", "air_title": "British Airways ", "Customer_name": "E Barr"}
