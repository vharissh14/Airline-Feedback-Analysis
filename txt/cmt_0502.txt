This was 25 minutes before the captain issued the \"Cabin Crew prepare the cabin for landing\" instruction. The Air New Zealand aircraft seats are particularly uncomfortable in upright position. On later politely querying why the cabin crew had pre-empted the captain by 25 minutes I was rebuked with the retort that it was a \"courtesy decision\". The only people provided a courtesy by the action were the cabin attendants themselves so they could relax during the rest of the flight.", "air_title": "Air New Zealand ", "Customer_name": "K Wolfson"}
