Very comfortable, quiet and smooth flight. The aircraft was exceptionally quiet on takeoff. Food and service top notch. Nice to have a free beer and wine with lunch. First time in LHR which I found to be a zoo, but excellent duty free shopping. LAX can also be a zoo but that's to be expected. BA flight crew very professional and courteous. Would fly them again, especially on the A380.", "air_title": "British Airways ", "Customer_name": "George Alba"}
