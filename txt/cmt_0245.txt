It was very clear that he could not be bothered. When the meals were being served he said to myself and my husband (do you want anything as if he was doing us a favour), we asked for nothing the whole of the trip. When arriving in Heathrow yet again he stood and watched me struggling to get the cases down as my husband only has one arm and could not help me. I have travelled many times with BA and always found the staff very attentive but sadly not on this occasion.", "air_title": "British Airways ", "Customer_name": "Patricia Walton"}
