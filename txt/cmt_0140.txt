Staff were helpful and polite - in fact they couldn't do enough for me. Seats were comfortable. Entertainment was OK and food was satisfactory. My only criticism is that on the outbound flight we were served lunch immediately on taking off but then had to wait neatly 7 hours for a light snack before landing. As I did not want to 'raid the larder' and eat fattening foods, I was left starving! I still find the overall experience with BA is far superior to any other airline.", "air_title": "British Airways ", "Customer_name": "C Goldhill"}
