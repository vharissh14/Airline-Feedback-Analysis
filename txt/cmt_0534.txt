Elderly travellers in their 80's. Premium economy in aircraft that I would guess is over 20 years old. Old square style seats with hard edges and absolutely no padding. I had a seat that was either up or fully down, no adjustments. TV so much static could not watch. Seat no wider than normal economy. Footrest moved only a bit. Premium economy in my opinion not worth the extra money. As of to date we still have to go home next week Dreading this painful event. Tried to request quote to upgrade to business class. Several emails sent asking for assistance and only received generic emails with no answers. Got quote by phoning NZ $1700 per person. We can't afford it. So we will remember the final international flight - but not in a good way. I will finish by saying that Sydney to Auckland sector on the new dream liner was excellent (in economy). Recommendation is \"better options out there for the money\".", "air_title": "Air New Zealand ", "Customer_name": "C Clark"}
