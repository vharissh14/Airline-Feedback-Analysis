Flight arrived late and departed even later due to the absolutely ridiculous length of time it took to board people. Finally got to my seat to discover a young girl with two kids occupying it. Shifted them out the way and continued. Had to help this girl with the seat belt for the child as no one seemed to have explained to her what to do. Flight was late so had to run out of terminal 5 which is no mean feat. If you are not in a rush use British Airways otherwise pick another airline.", "air_title": "British Airways ", "Customer_name": "N Harvey"}
