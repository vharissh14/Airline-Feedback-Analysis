The first leg was not all pleasant. The actual flight was smooth but the service was very disappointing. It was as though the passengers were an irritation, particularly to the male crew members. My in-flight entertainment system didn't work at all, but when I asked about this, shoulders were shrugged. I asked for an extra bread roll, having just seen a bag of spare ones being carried to the galley, to be told it was not possible. My half a cup of coffee was perfunctorily poured with a grunt. Happily, the second leg was much better although the seats seemed badly padded and were not comfortable when compared to other airlines. Staff certainly did not seem to be happy in their work, but were at least polite. If Jet Airways want to be seen as a world class airline, they need to be more consistent and realise that their business relies on satisfied customers. I have taken other Jet journeys over the last five years and had better experiences but this last one means that I shall think seriously before using them again.", "air_title": "Jet Airways ", "Customer_name": "Karen Magill"}
