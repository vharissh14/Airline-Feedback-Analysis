Friendly crew, good service. IFE has improved, too. New seats in economy are OK, but seem of poor quality as the recline function was already faulty after not a very long-time in service. I always notice that the crew 'vanish' after their routine service.", "air_title": "Lufthansa ", "Customer_name": "R Ingo"}
