I was so surprised how excellent the flight was! Comfortable, great inflight entertainment, great food (apart from the dessert) lovely service, drinks whenever we wanted. For such a budget price I think it's great. On the fight from Mumbai to Bangkok we even got to lie across 3 seats to sleep. Would highly recommend for the price.", "air_title": "Jet Airways ", "Customer_name": "Lucie Tyldesley"}
