Longest flight on the BA network. In each direction, the crew were brilliant, and nothing was too much trouble. IFE rather dated, and choices were only average. Food was ok, better than last year on this route. Actually had a very tasty steak out of EZE, which was pink, great! But full English breakfast is best avoided, the continental choice was excellent. On schedule both ways, and landed 30 minutes early both ways. Baggage arrived very promptly. For once there were no long queues at EZE. (Buenos Aires). I fly this route perhaps twice a year, 3 years ago, it was all pretty diabolical, but despite cutbacks crew all seem much more friendly, and the food is slowly improving. No other direct flights from LHR.", "air_title": "British Airways ", "Customer_name": "Robin Middleton"}
