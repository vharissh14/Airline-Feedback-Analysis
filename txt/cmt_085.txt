I was worried about taking a flight in India but was pleasantly surprised. The JetKonnect flight we took from Jaipur to Mumbai was pleasant. They charged us an over baggage fee, and were really strict with the weight. Only inflight complaint was that the seats barely had any padding, and were visibly marked and dirty. They looked like they were recycled from the 80's.", "air_title": "Jet Airways ", "Customer_name": "Tracy Ng"}
