The cabin was clean and the entertainment system functioned flawlessly. I was seated in coach somewhat in the middle section. The service was prompt and pleasant. Although, I don't eat airline food, the cabin crew completed service and quickly, quietly cleaned it up. The aircraft itself was quiet and the lighting system was much more pleasant (L.E.D.) than the standard type. Overall, better than many other transatlantic flights I've made.", "air_title": "Lufthansa ", "Customer_name": "C Teed"}
