Although it had a BA flight number, it was operated by Vueling, and that meant I couldn't use the BA lounge despite my silver Executive Club membership. I didn't choose Vueling, I was under the impression I had chosen BA and would get the BA perks just the same. There was no in flight entertainment (hence 1/5 - it should be 0 of course).", "air_title": "British Airways ", "Customer_name": "R Hanstock"}
