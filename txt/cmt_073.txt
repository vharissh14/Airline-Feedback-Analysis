Check in at Delhi was poor as the web check in counter was shut although there were many departures. Flight to Pune was comfortable as I had the first row. Bombay to jodhpur check in good with web check in fast and efficient. Flight was on time and crew okay. Food on Jet is quite awful and must improve.", "air_title": "Jet Airways ", "Customer_name": "Patel Rishad"}
