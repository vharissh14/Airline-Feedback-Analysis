First leg was on a 787, plane was nice but definitely does not have nearly enough toilets on board. Premium Economy passengers have quite a walk to the nearest lavatory (bad, bad design). On board service was very good, staff were great, food was good. Next leg from London to New Delhi was on a 777, much better in my opinion that the Dreamliner, primarily as it has better toilet facilities. Again staff and service were top notch. Our return trip in October was made with our newborn baby. If anything the service was even better than on our first leg. Thankfully we had a 777 on both legs and not the Dreamliner. Staff were incredibly helpful and accommodating, making a fuss about the baby and really always there to help. Again the food and beverage service was very good. The seat reclining buttons were a bit stiff, but other than that the seats were OK, not excellent, but definitely comfortable enough. Considering that I hadn't flown BA for over ten years before these flights (due to bad service) I was really pleasantly surprised by the improved level of service provided by the airline. Yes, being in Premium Economy helped, but I was very satisfied comparing it to Virgin Atlantic's Premium Economy which I have regularly used. Well done BA, you made a trip that we were dreading actually quite a pleasant experience and I'm likely to fly BA again now.", "air_title": "British Airways ", "Customer_name": "Garreth Elston"}
