Crew fantastic, aircraft clean, seats comfy, food excellent both ways. Cannot pick fault with anything apart from they advertise 50K as being a window seat when in fact you actually cannot see out of a window from this seat. I think it's time BA invested some money on the Gatwick club world cabins. The Heathrow product is 100 times better but the price difference does not reflect the difference in standard of service and product delivered.", "air_title": "British Airways ", "Customer_name": "M Dawes"}
