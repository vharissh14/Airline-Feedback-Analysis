Arrived early at Auckland Airport checked in with a customer service staff as their cost cutting exercise with no check in counters means that the check in kiosk does not work for when taking connecting flights and having to check your bags through. Arrived early at the gate ready to board at 6.15 am only to board 10 minutes prior to departure meaning we departed late as they have just one staff in charge of the boarding process. When on board felt like a sardine especially with the larger man in front of me with the seat bending back badly. Aircraft certainly ageing and seat very hard and uncomfortable. Food and drink okay but very basic. Entertainment outdated as well was watching something had already seen before. The Air New Zealand staff very casual and not really smiling at all and don't really care about the passengers as long as they are being paid. Can not recommend taking Air New Zealand again.", "air_title": "Air New Zealand ", "Customer_name": "Romeo Liebig"}
