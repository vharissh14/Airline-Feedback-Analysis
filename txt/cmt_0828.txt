Return Aug 14 2014, Prague to Frankfurt, flight LH1397. Frankfurt to JFK flight, LH404. My first and last trip with Lufthansa! I booked in Feb 2014 for a trip in Aug. My wife and I are senior citizens and booked bulkhead seating (knee problems). When we arrived at the airport we were informed that our reserved seats were given away. We were given no explanation and promptly given two middle seats in different aisles. When I protested I was told there was nothing that could be done. Later we were given middle seats next to each other. The TV screens did not work properly-a perfect ending to a terrible flight.", "air_title": "Lufthansa ", "Customer_name": "Tagariello Carl"}
