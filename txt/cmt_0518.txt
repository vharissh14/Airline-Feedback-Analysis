Poor customer service, poor communications. Poor seating. What more can I say, but poor. What is the point of preferred seating with airlines if they then change the aircraft type and do not move the allocated passenger seating around. I am well over 6 foot with a minor back injury and had booked an exit seat over 9 months in advance so that I could have a bit of comfort. It appears that the aircraft type was changed out of LAX, but this was not passed on to the passengers, so when we boarded I found my 'exit' seat was now stuck in the middle of the aircraft. Even with the seat in front of me fully raised I could not sit with my legs straight in front, rather splayed either side. When the seat was reclined I had no space at all and the insides of my knees were constantly rubbing against the seat in front and it meant that my knees were encroaching on the passenger next to me. Also, the media screen is then just inches from you and is pretty useless to view. Have never had this issue with Singapore or Emirates and as the national carrier and not a budget airline I would expect better from them.", "air_title": "Air New Zealand ", "Customer_name": "J Trimboy"}
