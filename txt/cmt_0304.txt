Flight departed on time and landed ahead of time in Heathrow which is a rare thing these days. No luggage to check and web check-in was working fine. Plane featured the new slim seats which are a step back in both comfort and legroom. Mixed fleet FA's were pleasant, however the service was not particularly well organized. It took them quite some time for the service to start and it took more than 30 minutes to get a drink after the sandwich has been served. On the other hand, the bacon sandwich was actually good and full bar service was offered. Other than the \u0093required service\u0094 of sandwich, drink and duty free, the crew was pretty much in hiding mode. Service not quite up to usual BA standards. BA uses a shared lounge in VIE, which this time was quite busy but not overcrowded. Lounge as such is acceptable, but far from great. Still believe that BA offers one of the best economy products on the European market and flying them is in general a pleasant experience.
