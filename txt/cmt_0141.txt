BA has now replaced all business class seats on short haul flights with seats so cramped that at 6'4\" I could not sit without great discomfort. This shows complete contempt for BA's customers. I first encountered this on a round trip to Brussels. It will be Eurostar for me in the future and Air France, for which I also gave a gold card, on other short hauls. Is the management so confident of its customer base that it can give us less space than Easyjet offers?", "air_title": "British Airways ", "Customer_name": "G Sainty"}
