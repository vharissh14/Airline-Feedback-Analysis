Domestic flight was excellent both ways, the new cabin is lovely, breakfast was very good, cabin crew very professional. LHR-JFK sector was excellent. Although the 747 cabin is extremely worn, the aircraft are being replaced in due course. The crew were very attentive and provided plenty of drinks, the meal was lovely too. On the way back the turbulence was severe and there were a lot of frightened passengers, the crew were very calm and reassuring and helped ease anxieties round the cabin.", "air_title": "British Airways ", "Customer_name": "M Gavin"}
