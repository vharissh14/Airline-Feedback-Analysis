The cabin crew were great and the service was fantastic. I ordered a vegetarian special meal and it was delicious. I was at one of the exit row seats and it was very cold. I talked to the crew about it and they took care of it immediately. I have been flying Lufthansa for the last 21 years and their service has been excellent. I never fly any other airline.", "air_title": "Lufthansa ", "Customer_name": "Gnanadesikan Ram"}
