Flight MUC to CLT with a small 330 / 300 Airbus. Flight was almost fully booked, but plane was not parked at the gate, but parked on the tarmac. Had to travel with busses. Plane was already delayed, and extra de frosting made the delay even bigger. Entertainment system needed re booting several times. Crew were friendly. When you fly a lot like I do, you expect a bit more variety of food - not always chicken with pasta.", "air_title": "Lufthansa ", "Customer_name": "B Niemeijer"}
