There was nothing at all to commend this flight. I have had better comfort and service on low cost carriers. The seats must be the narrowest in class for any major airline. The business lounge at Heathrow is not well signed, and awkwardly placed at the top of escalators. At 0830 in the morning, the tables were overflowing with used crockery and waste food. When staff did appear, they did a very cursory clearing job. Never once in two hours, did I see any of the sticky tables being wiped down. On boarding, I was neither shown to my seat, nor addressed by name, as I have been on other airlines. When I asked for assistance in putting my hand luggage in the overhead locker - I was told in no uncertain terms, staff were not allowed to help. Again I have always had help on business flights on other airlines. In the air, the level of discomfort rose as those in the inside seats were forced to jump over my out stretched legs and cabin staff leant over me to serve the inside seats. The level of service could not remotely be considered acceptable for the price paid. Add in poor food and IFE, and decision to avoid BA flights in future was made for me.", "air_title": "British Airways ", "Customer_name": "S Shailes"}
