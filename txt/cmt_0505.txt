Meals are excellent and so is the service, as well as a wide variety of drinks and snacks available throughout the whole flight. Vast entertainment selection with something for everybody. My seat on my recent flight from Auckland to Vancouver had a faulty remote for the entertainment screen, and the flight attendant was very helpful in trying to fix the issue whilst we were heading to the runway, but couldn't, so he said wait till we take off and I could move to another seat that has a working remote, and this was the only seat left in economy, which had only improved my view on Air NZ.", "air_title": "Air New Zealand ", "Customer_name": "Michael Nicholson"}
