The cabin crew are not attentive and a smile is seen as a bonus, the whole thing seems to be a cattle truck these days. Our flight was delayed (these things happen) but there is little in the way of welcome when boarding and the crew clearly don't want to be there, just simply going their motions. The headphones were broken both outbound and inbound, tea and coffee unavailable inbound, soft drinks, well what can I say self service with a disinterested crew. Inflight was very disappointing to say the least, some of the lowest quality I have come across in my travels. Drinks were simply rushed through and on 2 occasions had the cup and/or tray taken from my wife even though she was still eating! Not once but 2 times, the reason was simple they wanted to rush through and get the job done for their benefit and not the customer. Overall the crew were unprofessional and left numerous blinds down during landing and were even walking around the cabin with the seat belt signs on! I doubt that conforms with their operations practices. This was a good airline but now seems to behave as if they're doing the customer a big favour.", "air_title": "Jet Airways ", "Customer_name": "H Bath"}
