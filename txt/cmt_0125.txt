My return flight from Delhi to Dubai was in equally shabby condition (I think it was the same plane). What was worse is that they ran out of juice in the mid of first serving. I wanted to fill out a customer feedback form, but I wasn't served one.", "air_title": "Jet Airways ", "Customer_name": "Arun Sharma"}
