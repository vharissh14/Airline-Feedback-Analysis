For a full service airline the service was no better than a budget carrier. We were travelling with 3 children in our party of 11 and were seated at the rear of the plane. Both there and back the kids meals had run out by the time they reached us, as had the edible options of adult meals. The cabin was hot, which made for 2 very uncomfortable flights. We had to go and fetch our own complimentary drinks and snacks which my daughter did because she was so hungry - had she not gone we wouldn't even of been aware that they were available. Lesson learned - never fly BA again.", "air_title": "British Airways ", "Customer_name": "L Goddard"}
