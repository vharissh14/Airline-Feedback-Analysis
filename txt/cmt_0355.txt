Departing at 9:45 pm. Crew managed to serve dinner in record time, leaving maximum hours for sleep. Wine selection limited but of good quality. Dinner was fine - interesting first of meze, followed by a lamb that withstood the long transition from preparation to plate. An excellent experience in total.", "air_title": "British Airways ", "Customer_name": "John Geoffrey Pierson"}
