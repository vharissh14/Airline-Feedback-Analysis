Both flights on B777-300. PPT airport facilities and Business Class lounge basic, AKL Business Class lounge fully stocked yet overcrowded. Flight PPT-MEL: aircraft in pristine condition, full flat beds, mattress, duvet, pillow, amenity kit provided. Flight attendants explained in detail use of seat controls and provided a full turn-down service to each one of the passengers shortly after take-off. Humoristic and original safety instructions video. Breakfast was served some two hours before landing - adequate quantity, good quality, yet nothing impressive. Lavatories clean. Cabin crew very professional. Transtasman flight AKL-MEL: This service was not at the same standard as the previous. My seat - and several others - did not function at all, flight attendant had to restart them. Cabin crew more distant, restrained and not at the same professional level than in the previous flight. Food and beverages average. IFE system had plenty of choices. Arrived on time. One of my suitcases was partially damaged, yet ANZ in MEL arranged for its free repair. In conclusion, these flights were certainly not equal in quality : the PPT-AKL was a four-to-five stars service, the AKL-MEL a three-to-four stars service, leaving lots to be improved.", "air_title": "Air New Zealand ", "Customer_name": "E Karavelas"}
