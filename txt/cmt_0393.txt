After reading how the 747's are really starting to show their age, I opted to fly this return route on board the new 787 that BA has to offer. The outbound flight in economy a week earlier had been great, food and entertainment was good, staff very pleasant, but it was a bit of a tight squeeze in the seats, I think a 2-3-2 configuration would work a bit better. I arrived at Pearson Airport Terminal 3 booked to return to London in World Traveller Plus. Visited the Premium Plaza Lounge, nice and comfy, but nothing special. Boarding was really rather chaotic, but I was delighted to be upgraded to Business Class at the gate! Seat 3F was a good aisle seat, very comfortable, spacious, plenty of storage space and close to the toilets which I find more useful than bothersome, there was never any queue to use them that could've disturbed me. Cabin crew were superb and attentive, always addressing by name and happy to help with any queries and requests. The drinks service and the quality of the food was excellent, beef tenderloin followed by lemon tart and well presented. Whilst I generally struggle to sleep on flights, I found the flat bed very comfortable indeed, especially with the mood lighting on this night flight. Breakfast, a fruit salad and selection of pastries was again very pleasant to start the morning. On time departure and arrival, from Gate C66 at T5 through border control and luggage collected took just 25 minutes. Overall, highly impressive from British Airways, would absolutely use Club World again.", "air_title": "British Airways ", "Customer_name": "A Price"}
