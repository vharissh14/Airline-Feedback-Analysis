First leg delayed one and a half hours in Edinburgh with no explanation. Arrived at Heathrow and there was no operator available for the airbridge so sat on the plane for 15 minutes. Traveled onto Lisbon on a TAP code share flight and find our luggage had been left at Heathrow. An appalling example of customer service on every front.", "air_title": "British Airways ", "Customer_name": "S Storer"}
