LH 103, Munich - Frankfurt, 21 July 2014. During both flights because of the short time at disposal, and in spite of crew efforts, beverages were only served to some people. I suggest they only serve cold pre-packed drinks, and make sure they serve everybody.", "air_title": "Lufthansa ", "Customer_name": "Arlotti Giovanni"}
