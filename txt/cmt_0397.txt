Uncomfortable seats with Ryanair leg room so knees sticking into passenger in front. Poor service. Despite checking in 90 minutes before departure left 2 bags behind which were not delivered for more than 24 hours later, causing misery. Other passengers also shocked at conditions. If this is the new look business class BA then better off with Easyjet or Ryanair, much cheaper and service could not be much worse.", "air_title": "British Airways ", "Customer_name": "K Harrington"}
