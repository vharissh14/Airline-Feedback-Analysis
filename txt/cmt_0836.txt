The airplane was in good shape and there were no delays. I flew with my wife who has Senator status with Lufthansa and I could experience how warmly she was welcomed by the crew. Unfortunately this led them to neglecting me to an extend that I had to be after them to get something else to drink that what my wife had asked for. Somehow many of the Lufthansa crews on long distance flights still miss the opportunities to show some kind of friendliness and one still has the feeling that one is sitting in a bus from A to B. The special meal (Asian vegetarian) was tasty and the wine selections was good.", "air_title": "Lufthansa ", "Customer_name": "Schnitzer Bernd"}
