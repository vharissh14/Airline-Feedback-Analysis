I have done this trip on many occasions and have never been disappointed. Air New Zealand crew are so friendly and make you feel welcome. Due to ex tropical cyclone Marcia, the return flight was diverted to Brisbane and we were then bussed to the Gold Coast airport. This was done efficiently and without fuss. I like the A320 for these short flights across the ditch. I only ever sit in seat 1A and have no complaints to make whatsoever.", "air_title": "Air New Zealand ", "Customer_name": "Philip Crawley"}
