So essentially a short flight (3hrs). Crew were polite and sincere. Food was fresh and flavorful. Aircraft was of an older pedigree and seats were average. Entertainment system had options but Probably not enough for a long distance flight. Headphones weren't of a great quality (bring your own). Overall I was happy since food and the crew were great. Was good value for money as well. I wouldn't hesitate to fly them again.", "air_title": "Jet Airways ", "Customer_name": "S Bhatia"}
