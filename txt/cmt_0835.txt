I have 3 complaints about the flight with my wife last Thursday: 1) With the online check-in I could not get a boarding pass. There was a message that a failure occurred, but not which kind of failure and how to correct it. 2) There were two check-in lines at the airport. After 30 mins queuing Lufthansa personnel asked me for the boarding pass before I could continue in the line. As I could not get a boarding pass online or with the machine I could not go to the check-in counter. I had to queue in a second line. 3) At the other counter the seat reservation, which we made 3 weeks before was cancelled. All this is very disappointing.", "air_title": "Lufthansa ", "Customer_name": "Tautz Hanno"}
