Dear, oh dear - surely no one within BA could have said this seat as adequate for people paying a premium. I find the new seat absolutely horrible. It's very tight and I am unable to use my laptop. Flying BA Club Europe is no longer justifiable, because its no longer possible to work during the flight. Yes, the luggage rack moved to eye level. It does not give the 4 inches or so lost by moving the seats closer together. Seats are also very hard and extremely uncomfortable. Dear BA - please reconsider this terrible new seat, an attractive cabin alone does not make for a business class that is useful to business people.", "air_title": "British Airways ", "Customer_name": "R Schroeder"}
