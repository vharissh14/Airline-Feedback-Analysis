Crew very good the seat PTV and food not the best on this flight. I've used BA a lot over the past 2 years and find them pretty consistent although I've also noticed that service along with seats PTV of course is much nicer on the newer A380s or the 777-300s so it's worth choosing your aircraft. Otherwise ok flight.", "air_title": "British Airways ", "Customer_name": "C Cutts"}
