As a result I missed my connecting Air Canada flight from Frankfurt for Calgary. When I went to Lufthansa desk at the Frankfurt airport the ladies there were more than accommodating trying to offer me as many options as possible to get me to my destination. I opted for the next day flight to Calgary via Vancouver. The stay at the Interhotel at the Lufthansa expense was very pleasant, great food and room made me forget about a snag in my return trip. But the biggest surprise was still awaiting me at the boarding time when I learned that my ticket was upgraded to Business Class. Excellent service.", "air_title": "Lufthansa ", "Customer_name": "Borowy Irene"}
