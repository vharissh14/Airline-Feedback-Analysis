I flew Premium from LHR to MIA on a 747 and horrified to see that the Premium product has not changed in the last 10 years. BA have quite an ageing fleet now when compared to most European and Asian carriers and it really shows. The entertainment screen was absolutely tiny and the charging point is still that ridiculous adapter for which you have to pay an arm and a leg, so pleased I found mine from 7 years back! BA must go and have a look at the AF premium product for a wake up call. The food was okay, nothing to rave about and perfectly satisfactory, service onboard seems friendly and efficient however the state of the uniforms of some of the staff was shocking, not sure if its a case of poor quality material or lack of attention to appearances. I do remember the strap line \"BA, the worlds favourite airline\" but sadly they have slipped quite a long way back.", "air_title": "British Airways ", "Customer_name": "B Watts"}
