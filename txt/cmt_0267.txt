I paid premium economy but upgrade with avios so it was good value. Sat in the upper deck. FAs were attentive, helpful and accommodating. A good choice of beverages available and I consumed around 3 glasses of champagne and port during my main meal. Had the steak which were okay for an airline meal. The club kitchen was pretty well stocked with sandwiches, fruit, chocolate, cakes and champagne in plenty of supply. A light meal was offered around 90 minutes before landing, I had the afternoon tea (sandwiches) my wife a salad. Some excellent warm scones were provided. I was happy with my choice, but my wife thought the salad too light for a secondary meal. Overall the food was okay, but I have had better on Singapore Airlines, ANZ and even AA. The IFE system was dated with the screen being not as sharp as other airlines and the choice of movies limited compared to other airlines. On the return journey, I slept most of the flight after the meal. My wife reported the club kitchen was well stocked, contrary to some reports it is often empty on flights returning to Heathrow. A very positive note to report, the BA lounge at SFO is excellent, a good choice of food and drink, excellent space and I loved the direct access to the air bridge.", "air_title": "British Airways ", "Customer_name": "Alan Wan"}
