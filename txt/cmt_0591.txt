Flight attendants shared that these planes continually have issues with heat - and our video screen had messages from the \"pilot\" apologizing throughout the flight. I walked the length of the plane and found that some areas were okay but my guesstimate of 84+ degrees F in the area I was seated was not the only one getting cooked. I reached overhead for my laptop and one point and discovered that the storage area was significantly hotter than that! Miserable flight.", "air_title": "Air New Zealand ", "Customer_name": "Linda Wish"}
