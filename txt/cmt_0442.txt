Check-in / security: The former was smooth, friendly and efficient. The latter was very poor, on the basis that BA make no special provision for security with F class passengers either at their own hub (Heathrow Terminal 5) or any destination. F class passengers are not escorted which I consider to be a significant shortfall when clearing immigration and boarding flights. Lounge: Flagship lounge (Concorde Room) is quiet, elegant, reasonably well staffed and conveniently located after security. Good food in civilised portions served in the restaurant and a good selection of wines. IFE and Amenities: The TV is fairly decent, even on the refurbed 747s. Comfortable seats / beds with decent bedding and PJs. Good leg room, which I notice at 6'2\". Practical sized amenity kit which is fairly well stocked. Food: Decent food and well presented. Selection is sufficient, but no special options available pre-boarding. Crew: Generally affable crew who were professional. Not the fastest of service in comparison to other F products. Crew and captain introduced themselves to a number of passengers, which sits between those airlines where all passengers are chatted with and those who don't. I would say BA have the right approach, in that crew seem to visually assess whether a passenger looks like they would invite a social conversation - rather than imposing it anyway.", "air_title": "British Airways ", "Customer_name": "G Clement"}
