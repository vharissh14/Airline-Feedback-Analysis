SFO-LHR, First. Great flight with seat 1K at the nose of the jumbo. Cabin was half full so service was professional, friendly and efficient. Felt very much taken care of throughout the 10 hour flight. Cabin looked good and seat was comfortable especially in bed mode. The SFO lounge needs some work as not really first class more business The entertainment could be a little better in selection and screen quality. Overall, a really good product with exceptional service which BA is known for in First.", "air_title": "British Airways ", "Customer_name": "S Adlam"}
