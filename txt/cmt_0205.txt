The food was very good too, lovely and hot, large portions of chicken/beef tasty, liked the choices given so we were very happy. The new seat configuration on the Airbus we did not like, we were in row 8 then 6 and they were fine but I'd not like to be in the first row, right by the door and noticeably colder (stood right by the row queuing for the loo) and there is no bulkhead any more so it's a very small open space between the first row of seats, the loo and the galley! I'm only 5 ft 2 tall and very slim build and I found the loo cramped, looking around I couldn't see how 1/3 of the passengers would fit in it and I don't mean they were all way overweight, it is very small and slanting roof. A tall and big built person would not be happy! I gave inflight entertainment 1 as obviously they don't exist on short haul flights. The seats were far too upright and therefore uncomfortable, you could only recline them a bit or otherwise the poor person behind you wouldn't have had any space and I kept sliding forward on mine. The leg rest has gone too, so I had nothing to stop me moving forward and the space between rows felt a lot reduced.", "air_title": "British Airways ", "Customer_name": "P Carter"}
