Bag drop was fast, premium security slow (not BAs fault). Faultless calm boarding, on time and a great flight with good service and refreshments. Return flight bag drop even better, departure a little late due to a technical problem, the 737s are getting on a bit. Again, great inflight service and only a little late. Bags arrived as we got to the belt. Am very glad we chose BA for a 3 hour flight. Really good.", "air_title": "British Airways ", "Customer_name": "A Thompson"}
