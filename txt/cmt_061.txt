It is the worst of all Indian carriers. The seats were dirty and the ground staff were unfriendly. The Vegetarian food was awful. The entertainment system feels like it hasn't been updated in the last few years. Pay extra and do not travel on this airline.", "air_title": "Jet Airways ", "Customer_name": "S Akshay"}
