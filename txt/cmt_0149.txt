No lounge facilities at Cancun, only a voucher offered for use in departure area food outlets. On board, usual gymnastics to get in and out of seats, ran out of food choices for dinner, limited choice for breakfast, tea served in a cup without saucer. Cabin staff excessively noisy in galley throughout flight. Better value in cattle class.", "air_title": "British Airways ", "Customer_name": "Malcolm Shortt"}
