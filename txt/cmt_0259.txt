I am based in London and genuinely like LHR T5. Over the years I have seen the gradual downgrading of Club and First. Very nice new equipment with the A380 but other than being quiet and having an excellent entertainment system nothing has really changed. Paper salt and pepper sachets in Club, an amenity kit that is so poor its not worth opening. I mostly pay for my ticket and due to some excellent fares, will fly club, I can accept the downgrading as I sort of like the seat. First is now just about how club used to be, what happened to canap\u00e9s being offered as you sat down, where is the eat what you want, when you want service? Krug champagne! I I use my avios when travelling in First, I don't believe anyone pays a full fare in that cabin. Don't get me wrong, I like BA but just feel a little sad that the polish has gone from their premium cabins.", "air_title": "British Airways ", "Customer_name": "R Barnett"}
