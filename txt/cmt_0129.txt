It was an excellent experience. This time again travelled from London to Mumbai and return via Delhi in September 2013. Horrible experience as far as food and beverages are concerned. Drinks served only once. Food of average quality. Looks like the standard has reached the lowest level and now Jet Airways can be compared to Air India. Had recently taken a flight through Emirates which was wonderful. Will not fly Jet anymore.", "air_title": "Jet Airways ", "Customer_name": "Ratnakar Sinha"}
