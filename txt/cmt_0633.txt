Tran Tasman was okay. I know cabin crew seem to have a tough job, but at the end of flight was bombarded by crew asking for performance reviews to the cabin manager. Got a tad much after a while. Food pretty poor Auckland - Queenstown return. A small cookie and a tea for a 1 hr 45 min flight. Also in close proximity to screaming toddlers - the cabin crew gave out ear plugs but hey what can you do. Return trip in Premier sort of lacked the \"refinement\" of say Qantas or Cathay. Sort of too relaxed and friendly. Wouldn't go Business again for that short distance again.", "air_title": "Air New Zealand ", "Customer_name": "M Stringfellow"}
