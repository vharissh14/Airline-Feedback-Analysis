The snack was perfectly adequate but the bar service was diabolical. My husband asked for a beer which was bordering on warm. I asked for a Bacardi and diet coke, was advised had run out of Bacardi (bearing in mind we were one of the first to be served). I settled for a white wine, which was tepid, had to add ice to it. Further into the flight, my husband asked for a second beer, he was told that they had to save the beers for the return flight. Our crew were all slightly older, they were obviously very experienced to the point of doing everything automatically but not actually listening to the passengers. On our return flight we received almost the same service, only allowed one can of beer and no Bacardi. Very disappointing, we wanted to relax and celebrate our anniversary with an inflight drink. The return crew were slightly more attentive but the good old BA customer service was missing.", "air_title": "British Airways ", "Customer_name": "Susie Brownings"}
