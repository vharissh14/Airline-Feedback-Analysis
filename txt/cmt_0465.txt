Flew out Club Europe courtesy of a reduced fare by BA. We thoroughly enjoyed the experience. The Lounge in the satellite was more relaxed than the main T5 terminal. As it was an early flight the food was fresh pastries and small bacon baguettes which were excellent. Nice way to start a journey. The flight was good. Very attentive staff on the B767. My colleagues had recently flown easyjet and hadn't flown Club before and were very complimentary about the experience. The return was economy on a new A320. Impressed with the new style seats and again was a good experience.", "air_title": "British Airways ", "Customer_name": "A Cork"}
