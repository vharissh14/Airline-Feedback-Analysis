The seats were leather and comfortable, staff polite beautiful service. Food was delicious and the Drinks served was nice. I always liked BA's wine selection and they proved it again. There were no individual TV's but they did play a movie on both the flights, so that killed time. Boeing 767 flight have enough leg space. A happy on time flight with good service. Always satisfied with BA.", "air_title": "British Airways ", "Customer_name": "Balaji Krishnamoorthy"}
