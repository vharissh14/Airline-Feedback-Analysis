One of the last LH-routes out of Dusseldorf, because LH has transferred almost all European and domestic flights to Germanwings. That's a pity because once again LH showed why it's a great airline. Friendly staff -ground and air - and a very punctual performance on both legs. Tasty sandwich, two drinks and reasonable comfort on the A320. A little more expensive than the LCC's but it's worth it. LH stays my favourite airline. And once again Dusseldorf airport is a breeze.", "air_title": "Lufthansa ", "Customer_name": "Eelco van den Heuvel"}
