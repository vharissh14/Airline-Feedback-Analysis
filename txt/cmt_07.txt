It appeared that they used an aircraft traditionally used on shorter domestic routes on this sector. So leg space (space between rows) on the 5 hour flight was extremely cramped. What really made the flight unacceptable was that they turned off the aircon midway during the flight. It was only after the cabin became unbearable warm, passengers were roused from their sleep and a passenger complained, the aircon was switched on back - but barely so. The cabin remained uncomfortable. As others note, cabin crew were curt - bordering on rude. Jet is now my least preferred airline.", "air_title": "Jet Airways ", "Customer_name": "Abraham Paul"}
