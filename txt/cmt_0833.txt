Aircraft Airbus A340-600. Although I had checked Lufthansa site and was informed that my flight would have the \"new Business Class service\", it turned out that the small prints rule: this aircraft had the old and outdated Business class seats, which, from my point of view, cannot provide the comfort Lufthansa's competition offer, as none of its positions (seating, leaning, fully extended) could offer satisfactory comfort. Cabin crew very efficient, polite, discreet and professional. Food, wine and beverages more than average. IFE limited. Lavatories very clean throughout the flight. Cockpit and cabin crew announcements informative. Amenities of high quality.", "air_title": "Lufthansa ", "Customer_name": "Emmanuel Karavelas"}
