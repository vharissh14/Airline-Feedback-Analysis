We checked in online and printed our own boarding passes to save time and lock our seats in. When we arrived at the airport we had to go through the whole process again making our online check in pointless. The first leg of the journey was on a reasonably comfortable Boeing 777-200, but the second leg was on an Airbus A320 which was one of the most cramped airline seats I've ever sat on. Both planes felt old and tired. The meal we had was adequate but nothing more. I was quite disappointed overall, but one thing I'll say is the stay were very friendly and helpful.", "air_title": "Air New Zealand ", "Customer_name": "A Paterson"}
