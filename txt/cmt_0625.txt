Good comfortable seat. Female staff unfriendly, unhelpful, abrupt and unnecessarily rude to some passengers. Seemed they were plain irritated at being \"at work.\" that day. Sat at back, so had to accept what was left on the trolley. Food not very good either. Beverages were also slow in being supplied throughout the trip. Tv plus remote did not function properly, so did not watch any entertainment. Co-sharing SAA did not do it for me either on the first leg of my trip from SA. Sat on tarmac for an hour before take-off due to a \"technical\" problem. Will definitely not fly Air NZ again.", "air_title": "Air New Zealand ", "Customer_name": "C Stander"}
