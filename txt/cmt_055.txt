Bangkok to Mumbai to Kolkata to Bagdogra, returned two weeks later. I had first booked a direct flight from Bangkok to Kolkata, but two weeks later Jet Airways made a schedule change and simply emailed me to tell me that the Bangkok - Kolkata flights were cancelled, with no information about where I stand in regards refunds and rebooking. However, I phoned a phone number here in New Zealand and the consultant worked hard to come up with a suitable alternative for me, which meant longer flights and less sleep, but ensured that I got to where I needed to be and charged me no extra. I got the feeling that running on time was very important to the airline, one leg was 10 minutes late and it was made clear to us that it was due to a late inbound aircraft due to congested air traffic (ie: not Jet Airways' fault). They hurried us through boarding so that time could be made up. Food and staff were fine, check-in staff very helpful and friendly. Ironically, at the slightest bump in the sky seat-belt sign was on and we were told to remain in our seats, yet prior to take-off staff didn't come and check seat-belts, and also a passenger two seats over from me was busy talking on her phone during take-off and staff didn't address this even though the safety briefing had been very clear. There was no in-flight entertainment on the planes I took, and the seats didn't recline, but good service otherwise.", "air_title": "Jet Airways ", "Customer_name": "K Morris"}
