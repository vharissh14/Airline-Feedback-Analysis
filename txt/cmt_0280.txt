Disappointing that BA has downgraded its CE service to such an extent that it is not really worth paying the extra for short haul. Too little leg room now such that new seats are no different from Economy - yes, the middle seat is not occupied but what both my partner and I would like is additional leg room. Not good enough to pay the extra and then have to sit at an angle to fit into the seat. New seats are uncomfortable as well. Lunch service reminiscent of Economy food trays of the 80s too. Cabin crew doing their best with a full club cabin - CE clearly still popular for the moment even with revised cabin layout, but for how much longer? Can no longer recommend BA for a four hour short-haul, although good time-keeping. Such a shame that BA has allowed this to happen. Think again, BA.", "air_title": "British Airways ", "Customer_name": "S Tilton"}
