Why pay extra for something you are not going to get! Cabin service slow - over an hour until meal served, had to ask for another drink as only 1 small bottle given. They also ran out of the main choice meal and the cabin was not full, had second choice meal and this was cold. To Fly to Serve - I think not. Terrible service for an airline that is supposed to pride itself on service.", "air_title": "British Airways ", "Customer_name": "Dave Mcdermott"}
