The check in was seamless and the guy behind the desk couldn't have been more helpful or accommodating. The seats were great - plenty of room and the airplane was a fairly new Boeing 777. The staff were generally very good but the stewards were more accommodating than the stewardesses - why I don't know. The flight was on time and it was a good all round experience.", "air_title": "Jet Airways ", "Customer_name": "Mick Perris"}
