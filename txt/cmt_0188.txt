End of a One-World RTW trip. What a disappointment. After a mind-numbing trip through Flight Connections (BA to BA) and a 15 minute walk to the last gate on the B concourse only to get on a 12-15 minute bus ride, i was escorted to the F/C cabin which reminded me more of a rabbit warren than an airplane. The aisle was so narrow that it was impossible to put my carry-on bag in the overhead over my seat. Very claustrophobic. Seat was strange. Very narrow and difficult to sleep in - at least 6-7\" narrower than the seats on CX or AA. Strange recline mechanism - normally, you can adjust the recline and the foot rest separately but not in here. The seat reclines in one motion so you can't \"fine tune\" it like with other airlines. Menu looked fantastic - apps were good, salad was nothing special and the main course (Indian style Lamb) was virtually inedible. Cheeses were good, desserts and wines OK. EVOD was not to the standards of the competition. Fewer movies and TV selections than either AA or CX. Crew was fine. Stick with AA/CX from now on.", "air_title": "British Airways ", "Customer_name": "Charles Berlin"}
