We were kept on the tarmac for four hours with very little information, and eventually told there was a technical fault so we would not be flying for another 24 hours. I needed to call my workplace to arrange work cover but the cabin staff said there was no BA phone I could use. Passengers had to go back through immigration in the middle of the night, there was chaos around the baggage reclaim and a real lack of information from ground staff who appeared to have little direction on what to do. We were eventually taken at 4 am to a hotel where the hotel staff were unable to cope with the numbers needing rooms - families were separated. BA did not publicise the right of all passengers to EU compensation but I knew about this so did apply and receive the legally required amount promptly. All in all this was a hugely disappointing and frustrating experience from an airline that had previously been my preferred airline and I would no longer recommend BA.", "air_title": "British Airways ", "Customer_name": "K McCarthy"}
