Mumbai to London Heathrow, 20 Oct. Gold member - yes, premier class - yes, web check in - yes. 10 minutes delayed coming from terminal 5 to terminal 4 - already checked in but not allowed to board with more than 45 minutes to spare. Unprofessional in handling passengers and unprofessional in dealing with complaints. Got myself another full ticket on Air India as that was the only option available 2 hrs later. I fly every month and being a gold member this was not what I expected.", "air_title": "Jet Airways ", "Customer_name": "Jayesh Kumar"}
