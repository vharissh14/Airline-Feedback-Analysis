LHR-BOM was less than 30% full, resulting in a great, quiet flight. Departed on time and arrived early. Bulkhead seat with lots of legroom, friendly crew, who even offered hot towels on departure to economy passengers because business class was so empty. In flight entertainment relatively extensive, and food was okay - offered a curry meal plus a hot chicken wrap later on. Drinks were offered several times. Seat was comfortable and overall a great flight. BOM-HKG night flight was packed full. Had a seat near the back with pretty bad legroom. Served ice cream upon departure and breakfast (which was vile) before landing. Return flight a few months later to BOM was 100% full. Bulkhead seat again, so leg room no problem. Entertainment and food were still pretty good and crew were as friendly as ever on Jet. The cabin was absolutely freezing though. Final flight, BOM-LHR was pretty poor. Seats and entertainment still good, crew still friendly. But absolutely no drinks or food offered for the first 8 hours! Breakfast eventually served, but I passed, having experienced the horrors of breakfast on Jet a couple of months ago. Biggest problem is Mumbai airport - the transfer process is confusing and unorganised and the airport itself is horrible. Not really Jet's fault though, I guess. For the price I paid, I would recommend Jet and fly with them again if they remained significantly cheaper than others on this route.", "air_title": "Jet Airways ", "Customer_name": "L Douglas"}
