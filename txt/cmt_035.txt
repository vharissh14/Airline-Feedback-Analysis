We had only two pieces of checked in baggage, weighing totally 17 kgs. The flight was very cramped. No foot rest. Keeping the legs down with no support was very uncomfortable. There was no legroom, the front seat passenger reclined his seat and it almost hit my face. More bad news awaited us at Mumbai airport. We waited for our luggage, only one piece arrived. After waiting for almost 45 minutes, we saw that the message displayed last bag. There were many people still waiting but none of our baggage came. When we went to the Jet airways counter, they simply said that our luggage had been offloaded due to the plane being overloaded. No compensation offered. We had no option but to give the details of our baggage that was still stuck at Kuwait airport. After all this, we had to keep calling customer relations number that was provided regarding our baggage only to be told time and again that it was still in Kuwait and they had no idea when the baggage would arrive.", "air_title": "Jet Airways ", "Customer_name": "N Mona"}
