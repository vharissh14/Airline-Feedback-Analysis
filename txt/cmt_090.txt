Air hostesses behaved as though they are doing passengers a favour, did not attend to passengers in time. While travelling from UK to Goa, there were no toilet rolls in the toilet. While returning back there was no hand wash. Although meals were included but were not provided, in fact they stated I had to pay for my meal from Goa to Bombay. Requested a cup of tea, it never arrived.", "air_title": "Jet Airways ", "Customer_name": "Suzana Mendes"}
