I arrived on time at LHR from Brazil using a different carrier. Journey thus far was enjoyable and on time. I know that that shortest final hop up to the north east is usually the most problematic and unpleasant, so I arrived fully expecting to land at Newcastle and get home late. However yesterday morning I was wrong, my flight wasn't running late, it was cancelled! I had a particularly revolting encounter with one of their \"professionals\" in T5. My courtesy and understanding towards the inept individual who was there to assist delayed passengers, was rewarded with the cheap nasty, passive aggressive and generally dismissive attitude which is offered so frequently by BA these days. No apology or empathy just waffle and rubbish. It's just simply not good enough, and a terrible reflection of what our flag carrier has become. To cut a long story short, I arrived at NCL seven hours late. And no surprises my luggage was left behind at T5. But then again BA only had seven hours to transfer it onto my flight. Well done BA! Simply the worst customer service that I have ever experienced anywhere!", "air_title": "British Airways ", "Customer_name": "S Mordey"}
