Not until I got to the payment stage did I realise that of the 4 flights only one short flight to Madrid was actually on a BA plane. The others were with Iberia Airways. I understand that flight operators have to partner with other agencies, but you would expect then that they would adhere to standards expected of the original operator. Standards were very poor. No inflight entertainment on a 12 and 13 hour flight. Poor food and on the last leg of the journey, we were even expected to pay for our food. What is this a budget airline at full blown prices? Again on this last leg, the toilets weren't flushing! So at oyr destination they were almost full. My advice would be check who you're actually flying with.", "air_title": "British Airways ", "Customer_name": "D Thomas"}
