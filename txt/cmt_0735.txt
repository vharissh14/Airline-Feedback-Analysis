As it is quite common with this airline, the plane was in impeccable condition and practically new, however the space - or lack thereof - in economy class is a bit extreme. I think the German engineers went overboard and squeezed a few too many rows into that bird. My inflight entertainment system worked fine, but my wife's next to me didn't. The flight attendant told her 2 or 3 times that she would look into it and reboot the system, but then she never did. Nothing major, but a little more attention would have been nice.", "air_title": "Lufthansa ", "Customer_name": "S Toljan"}
