I was upgraded to \"Premium Economy\" due to Senator status and a full plane, so they bumped \"upwards\". It was a new 747-800 so the screens were OK and picture quality good. Positives: Better food than regular economy. Better legspace and seat pitch than regular economy. Negatives: Lousy headphones, same as regular economy, so could not hear the movie properly. Premium economy cabin was \"messy\". Strange sharing with regular economy in 4 rows before Premium, and approx 8 rows behind in mid section. So premium was in the middle of regular economy so it did not feel special in any way, it was just as flying regular economy but with better legroom. Service level was same as regular economy due to the location of the cabin. I don't think it is worth the extra cost (600 Euro more for round trip FRA-IAD) for so little extra comfort. If LH reaches Thai Airways premium levels then it is worth the extra money.", "air_title": "Lufthansa ", "Customer_name": "T Persson"}
