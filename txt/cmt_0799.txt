My seat was dirty, with crumbs in the glasses holder, wasn't able to use my own headphones for in-flight entertainment, and the movies system was slow, unresponsive and had few movie choices. I watched a DVD that I brought rather than dealing with these issues. The food was ok but unimpressive, although the croissants were fresh and tasty. I thoroughly enjoyed the red wine and was constantly refilled, as well as coffee when I switched, and the seat was comfortable once I was able to manipulate my 6'1\" frame into a comfortable position. All in all, the flight was fine but I wasn't as impressed as I should have been.", "air_title": "Lufthansa ", "Customer_name": "J Stein"}
