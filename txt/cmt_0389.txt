Flight delayed by several hours which meant arriving back into Heathrow T5 at gone midnight after most of the public transport links had ceased running. Nobody at BA available to help (despite them knowing the flight was several hours late arriving) which resulted in having to sleep at the airport floor overnight. Appalled that BA would do this - it was an unpleasant experience but I coped but what about elderly travellers? To make matters worse there was nobody available as a BA representative at Munich airport during the delay until I complained.", "air_title": "British Airways ", "Customer_name": "Jamie Fenton"}
