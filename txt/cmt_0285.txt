Having flown BA long-haul twice previously in economy, we decided to pay $900 extra round-trip for World Traveller Plus. All we got for the money was legroom. Terrific, because I'm 6'3\", but not worth the price. The trick to airline comfort - and there is no such thing unless you're flying business or first class - on a long-haul flight is to book the \"4\" section of 3-4-3 in economy, and hope that the two people beside you and your travel companion are smart enough to figure out that the quickest way to the aisle is to go across one person, not two. Let's face it, all you want from a long-haul flight are comfortable seats (and the new generation of thinner seats receives mixed reviews) and acceptable food. You expect safety and timely arrival, which depends on weather and other variables not controlled by the airline.", "air_title": "British Airways ", "Customer_name": "J Landers"}
