The flight was cancelled due to technical problems with the aircraft. Such things are entirely understandable. But right from the way this information was delivered to the way the 300+ dislodged passengers were handled was simply appalling. Those with kids and the elderly were not looked after well. Those who kicked up a lot of fuss were given seats in the next flight. After waiting for 4 hrs on a queue I have been re-routed with BA and I will be attending the conference two days late with having to request a reschedule of my talk. My bag was not given back to me! The treatment I have received so far by the BA staff is simply excellent. Never again Jet Airways!", "air_title": "Jet Airways ", "Customer_name": "C D Sudarshan"}
