There were 6 sectors with the round trip and every single sector, the flight was on time or early. The food was very nice and service excellent. The Delhi - Brussels and Brussels - Toronto were excellent. Ground staff at Delhi were not helpful at all as immigration wouldn't allow passengers into the Gates any earlier than 4 hrs before the flight, as a transit passenger I was stuck in the middle.", "air_title": "Jet Airways ", "Customer_name": "Sellaththurai Kula"}
