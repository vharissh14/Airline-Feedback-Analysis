I was meant to have flown with Air New Zealand from Los Angeles to Heathrow, but they ran out of seats and over booked the flights. So I'm now leaving a day later. I was quite upset to have been told there were not enough seats for me, but the compensation came as a surprise. They offered me night over in a hotel with dinner, lunch and breakfast included and to top it off cash to keep me going. So I'm very thankful for that and very impressed in the way they handled the situation. I have been guaranteed a seat on the same flight, but a day later.", "air_title": "Air New Zealand ", "Customer_name": "Tamlin Hayes"}
