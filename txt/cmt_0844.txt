The screens also were periodically unresponsive. The lights could not be adjusted (had to be turned on manually since seat panel was not working at all). One flight attendant was lovely - very helpful and apologetic. Others clearly did not care. Indeed, one kept insinuating that we were not being patient enough with the screen - she finally believed it was the system's failure when she tried it. Although the helpful attendant reset the system, it did not work (until the plane completely shut off after landing - then the panel started working). Also, when the person in front of me reclined his seat, I could barely move. The helpful attendant gave us chocolates at the end of the flight, which was very nice. It was an extremely uncomfortable and frustrating flight. We had paid the same amount as all the other folks who had working electronics.", "air_title": "Lufthansa ", "Customer_name": "C Whitten"}
