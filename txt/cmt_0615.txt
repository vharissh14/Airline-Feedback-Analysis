Consistently warm, helpful and willing staff. Excellent product on the 777 with the thicker mattress on the bed (compared with Virgin Atlantic) and restaurant quality food and wine selection. Toilets are extremely small but there is a disabled one available in premium economy. Overall excellent interaction despite missed connection due to another carrier. Overall I would always choose to fly with AirNZ if possible. Unfortunately let down by their alliance with United who are the antithesis of everything AirNZ is. Would love them to have wider seats in Business on 767 as I choose to travel in business due to size and not to disturb or impede people next to me if I flew in economy. The 767 seat is my least favourite aspect of the experience.", "air_title": "Air New Zealand ", "Customer_name": "J Harris"}
