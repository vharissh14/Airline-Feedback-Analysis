Overall it was a good flight - cabin ambience with the mood lighting and black seats was great, seat comfort was also good, inflight AVOD good, food good, and friendly flight attendants that came by every 30 minutes or so with water. I would recommend Air New Zealand. The only thing I didn't like was 10 abreast in economy which meant that it was difficult to walk down the aisles without weaving through people's elbows and legs.", "air_title": "Air New Zealand ", "Customer_name": "Nicholas Edwards"}
