A group of 5 of us were travelling from Delhi to Kochi via Bangalore. Our flight was late arriving in Bangalore (landing at the time our connecting flight was due to depart). We were unloaded onto the tarmac (not at a gate). The ground staff immediately directed us to a waiting special bus organised to move the 5 of us to the connecting flight. We jumped on the bus and then a few moments later the ground staff came up with our luggage. Within 10 minutes of landing at Bangalore we were on the connecting flight (with our luggage!) and taxiing for take off. It was simply outstanding service and I congratulate Jet Airways!", "air_title": "Jet Airways ", "Customer_name": "Edward Kerr"}
