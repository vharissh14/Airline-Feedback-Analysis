It was my first experience with the airline and was a little nervous as the reviews were not that great. But surprisingly my flights were almost on-time. The food was delicious and satisfying. Alcohol was available whenever needed (a big plus point). The seat was comfortable. The only negative throughout the itinerary, was at London Heathrow where there was some chaos, but that too was not the airline's fault at all. Things to improve can be probably: the staff could be a little more visible when needed, and use of better headphones to go with the great entertainment system. I have traveled on the Mumbai-London route a lot, and Jet Airways is definitely up there.", "air_title": "Jet Airways ", "Customer_name": "J Smith"}
