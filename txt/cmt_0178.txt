Plane a Boeing 777 which was very old and thus the entertainment screen was small. The main dissatisfaction was the food - going out it was the worst that we had ever had in long haul and coming back it was not much better. The choices ran out when the cabin crew got to me (comment someone has to be last and unfortunately it is you sir). I finally got my choice when the Captain gave up his first choice! Other airlines, particularly middle east and far east based do a much better job.", "air_title": "British Airways ", "Customer_name": "B Starkey"}
