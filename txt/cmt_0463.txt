YVR to LHR on August 28, 2014. Premium economy. Much below previous experiences flying in this cabin on BA. Staff were indifferent and inattentive. The meals were deplorable! Despite being a small cabin, there was only one meal choice left half way through the dinner service - a very heavy and overly rich pasta dish, accompanied by an equally heavy piece of dry chocolate cake. Hardly suitable food for a long flight. Breakfast was worse - an equally heavy fruit muffin and tea or coffee. Very poor! A number of seats in this cabin, have metal boxes underneath, rendering the much-advertised additional leg room, useless. IFE far below what it used to be in terms of quality and variety of programming. A very unpleasant experience and definitely not worth the additional cost.", "air_title": "British Airways ", "Customer_name": "Christopher Neep"}
