We are senior citizens and have lots of air travel experience, but this one was the worst so far! There was no water in the toilets! The flight from HYD to AUH arrived and landed but it took more than an hour before we could get off the plane! Apparently Jet seems to have the least priority by air traffic control. Me and my wife had to sit near a stinking toilet for the 526 flight. They closed all toilets. Imagine having no access to toilets in mid air! Will never fly Jet again.", "air_title": "Jet Airways ", "Customer_name": "Syed Mazharullah"}
