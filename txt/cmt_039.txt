Service was awful. Toilets were dirty. Food served was stale and badly presented. Staff were very apologetic but could do nothing and blamed their caterers. When we landed, I wanted to complain but the ground staff said there was nothing they could do. Gave me an email address to write to. I duly wrote to them and nothing since, not even an acknowledgement. Never again will I fly this airline.", "air_title": "Jet Airways ", "Customer_name": "Rajiv Khanna"}
