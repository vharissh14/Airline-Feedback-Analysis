Booked seats beforehand to make sure that we had front row seats, only to get on the plane and discover contrary to what the webview had displayed we were bang smack in the middle of a row of seat! Complained to BA and told that, the maps you can see on ba.com are representative of the seats on board flights and that they cannot guarantee your seat will be exactly as shown on our website, as the configuration can vary depending on the aircraft you're travelling on. What a total rip off! The seats were extremely cramped, our inflight entertainment system keep failing. Once the food had been dished out and tidied away, the flight attended disappeared completely and absolutely no water or drinks were offered until we were about two hours from landing! BA need to get their act together and invest in better aircraft's. Clapped out 747s - even first class looked shoddy!", "air_title": "British Airways ", "Customer_name": "Garry McMinigal"}
