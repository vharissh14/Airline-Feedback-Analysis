New updated 777-200 for one of its first flights on the route. Generally a smooth ANZ service, with the staff obviously enjoying the new updated plane. The seats etc were very much like the 777-300ER with updated touch screen movies, much improved than the old toggle system. Great updated menu from Peter Gordon, more interesting meals. Delay due to weather that held us on the tarmac before departure, but they were flexible and let people up are around to the bathrooms, despite having left the gate. Hard to fault a new internal refreshed interior, and great staff.", "air_title": "Air New Zealand ", "Customer_name": "K Gunn"}
