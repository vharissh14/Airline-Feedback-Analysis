To be honest I don't know the difference between this airline and the poor standards of Air India. The seats were rock hard and cramped and I had to put a pillow underneath. So uncomfortable. Food was very bland and nothing special. Service was slow. The only good thing were the young pretty girls of Jet Airways.", "air_title": "Jet Airways ", "Customer_name": "Manveen Rana"}
