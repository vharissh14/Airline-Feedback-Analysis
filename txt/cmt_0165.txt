First leg not too bad apart from ridiculously narrow seat, which is exactly the same as economy seat, but a spare one in between. Usually seats are moved so that they are wider with a narrow seat in the middle. The return was terrible. BA do not pay for Cub Europe travellers to use Fast Track at security - disgraceful, especially as it is particularly slow and inefficient. The lounge is mediocre at best. Absolutely not worth paying for Club. BA need to get a grip on their falling standards and increased prices.", "air_title": "British Airways ", "Customer_name": "Angie Kirkpatrick"}
