No Business class priority while Boarding or at security. No flat beds only reclining seats (on a night flight). Polite and friendly staff but poor Food and refreshments, old cabin and broken facilities (reading light). No inflight entertainment system. On Arrival baggage had been offloaded to make way for freight and only turned up 48 hours later. I had to go to the Airport to collect it, no delivery. Conclusion: will never fly Jet Airways again!", "air_title": "Jet Airways ", "Customer_name": "Neil Hatton"}
