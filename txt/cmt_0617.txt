Being a TG Platinum member I don't often travel on other carriers, but have no real choice when it comes to the US. Have to say that flying NZ is a predominantly pleasant experience with real food served restaurant style, a fantastic lie flat bed (even in the old planes) and great service from experienced cabin crew. So in the air great, but on the ground they leave a lot to be desired. The self serve check in at MEL is a joke. It is not a premium service and you need to manually check that your baggage is tagged priority. AKL boarding is a schmozzle with very small gates and loads of passengers. Forget about trying to access the premium boarding gates! So all in all great on board, but lousy on ground.", "air_title": "Air New Zealand ", "Customer_name": "G Warren"}
