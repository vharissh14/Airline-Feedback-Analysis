It was a pleasant trip. Comfortable seats, nice and very helpful flight attendants. Unlike e.g. British Airways which I have used for my last two trips to North America the catering on board was great. Additional water or juice e.g. was served regularly. The snack before landing consisted of Wei\u00dfwurst Pralinen and a Laugenbr\u00f6tchen which was very delicious. I asked for an extra portion which I got without any hesitation. They would have thrown away any leftover food anyway so I thought eating another portion would be better as it was extremely good. The only downside to the flight was that the aircraft engines are quite loud compared to other aircraft's. Also, the choice of films could have been better. Overall I was very satisfied.", "air_title": "Lufthansa ", "Customer_name": "Lekon Niels"}
