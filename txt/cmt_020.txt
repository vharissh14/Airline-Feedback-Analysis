The schedule was changed at least half a dozen times during the course of the year. CJB to MAA was on an ATR72 that included a complimentary meal as part of the rebranding exercise. MAA to BOM and BOM to CCU operated by B737 variants with the second leg departing almost 75 minutes late but landing only 30 minutes behind schedule. Emergency row seats made it a pleasant journey despite the negligible delay. Jet Airways continues to be reliable within India.", "air_title": "Jet Airways ", "Customer_name": "Krishnan Chitoor"}
