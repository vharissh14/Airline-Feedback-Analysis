The SIN-BOM sector used to be operated by the airbus A330 which was good since it was value for money and it was a bigger and more comfortable plane. Adding to a reason why you would chose jet over sq. (mainly for the money). But now they use the Boeing 737 which is a relatively small aircraft and very cramped. It was very uncomfortable. The food was ok although unnecessarily flavorfull. The TV had a good selection of movies however extremely inconvenient as the touch screen was very slow and required lots of pressure to select a movie. Overall it was a average flight. However I was very disappointed as I paid for a business class ticket for all my flights (all the way to London and back) but it was oversold so I was put in Economy. With no refunds, but oh well its only a 5 hour flight. Luckily my flight from Mumbai to London was still business class. In fact they upgraded me to First class for compensation. But I did want to review the 737 business class product. Jet really needs to make their seats in the 737 more comfortable.", "air_title": "Jet Airways ", "Customer_name": "Joeseph Williamson"}
