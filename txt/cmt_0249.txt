To be honest I wasn't looking forward to this flight as it was one of BA's so called \"Leisure Flights\". However I was pleasantly surprised at the high level of service, quality of food and wine and friendliness of the crew. Seat 4A is recommended as you don't have to step over anyone to access the aisle. I was first on the plane and first off it, just a pity my bags were not the first to arrive.", "air_title": "British Airways ", "Customer_name": "Andrew Hickling"}
