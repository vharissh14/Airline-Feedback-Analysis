BCN-FRA flight was decent (same seats as economy nothing to write home about, good breakfast, warm service) but for some reason was parked halfway down the Rhine valley when it arrived in Frankfurt. Took over 40 minutes to make my connecting flight at literally the other end of the airport. For some reason, Frankfurt airport staff thought it necessary for all buses to wait for all passengers to leave the aircraft before staring the long trek to the terminal, instead of a bus starting off when full. FRA-DEL flight was on the A380 with the old style angled flat seats. Given that both of Lufthansa's supposedly downmarket brands (Swiss and Austrian) have better long haul business seats, Lufthansa has no excuse for continuing with this substandard product. To add to the cost-cutting feel, the portions of food served on the flight seemed smaller than those I've gotten in the past on LH. At least the IFE worked fine and has good choice and the staff tried hard to keep the passengers happy. Would recommend flying Lufthansa business only if flying on an aircraft with the new business class.", "air_title": "Lufthansa ", "Customer_name": "Devottam Sengupta"}
