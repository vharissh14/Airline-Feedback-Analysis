Bangkok-Mumbai sector seems to be where they send their old planes with seats falling to bits. They often feel overcrowded due to Indian passengers bringing on those huge striped bags bulging with stuff, which are about 4 times the 'carry-on' size and don't fit anywhere..but fortunately this is only a short flight. From Mumbai or Delhi to London, the planes are always new and pretty well served by the crews. I've had exceptionally good service and pretty poor service on Jet. But the ticket prices are always very good value, so I keep coming back. I find the food is generally OK, identifiable and edible. And that's about all. The crew don't mind getting extra food and drinks in my experience. Seats are small, cramped and uncomfortable for anything over 5 hours. I often wander to the back door area to get the blood in my legs running again and I have found the crew - with the exception of a few rude guys - understanding and obliging. Entertainment on Jet is, as most people say, not very entertaining. There are a few sitcoms and movies you've seen. I read my kindle and my daughter is locked into her laptop so this is not a problem for us.", "air_title": "Jet Airways ", "Customer_name": "Lester Rod"}
