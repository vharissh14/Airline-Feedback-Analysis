This was a non stop flight and although the food and service were ok only, the entertainment system was extremely disappointing. It was antiquated - limited movies, music, games and news. The push button hand control needed extra pressure going over. On the return flight, it was not possible to get any music at all. The system was rebooted (nothing); I was taken to two other seats (still no music). Compared to Emirates' flights, this experience with Air NZ was extremely disappointing.", "air_title": "Air New Zealand ", "Customer_name": "Carolyn Beadle"}
