This flight reminded me of just why I rarely fly BA. Most of the crew were disinterested. I raised a couple of points but I was told I was wrong both times. Asked for another glass of wine twice with my main, the stewardess forgot and denied that I had even asked for one. Food going out was pretty good, but coming home just awful. I for one can just not get my head round the seat formation. You stare at some stranger on take off and landing, food and drinks for passengers on the inner seats are pushed in front of your face.", "air_title": "British Airways ", "Customer_name": "D Martin"}
