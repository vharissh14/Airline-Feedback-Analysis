Blank seat tickets were issued and luggage taken for flight. At check in told we would have to wait on a reserve list. As this was part of a holiday trip and booked months ago I can not see how our booked seats where not available. These were paid for months ago so you now those seats are sold and therefore cannot understand how you can overbook. Latecomers should wait until all sold seats check in and then offer what is left to them not give away other peoples seats. This was LH2510, 9 Aug. We finally got seats far apart from each other.", "air_title": "Lufthansa ", "Customer_name": "L Haycock"}
