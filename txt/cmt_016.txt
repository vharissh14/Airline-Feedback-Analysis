Flight out on Christmas Eve and the airport was busy. Had done a web check in and staying in the web check in line for our bag drop off. Rude jet airways staff told us it was not for web check in but for a delayed Delhi flight only. We were not served and had to move to another line. Following that, flight was fine and staff were polite. Food onboard was awful. Dry snack like roll. Rather buy food on board than have terrible free food. Return check in at Bhopal was great.", "air_title": "Jet Airways ", "Customer_name": "Rishad Patell"}
