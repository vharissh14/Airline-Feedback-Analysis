The food was awful. Inflight service was a disaster - did not work properly. 12 hours 20 mins flight, everything counts, obviously BA overlooked this. To be fair, all cabin crew were polite and accommodating. I will never fly again with BA.", "air_title": "British Airways ", "Customer_name": "Ray Desjardins"}
