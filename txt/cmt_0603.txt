Seat 2A and 2B. Seat quality - poor as the seats are too narrow! The monitors are stored in the middle armrest, that leads to a very small seat, less felt wide as in ECO. Recliner would be ok, but the width is very poor for a 12 hours flight in Business Class! Team great, food - in case of the Shanghai trip very \"Chinese oriented\" and not typical for ANZ hopefully. So if the flight is done by a 767-300 - avoid! The 777-200 seat quality is much better.", "air_title": "Air New Zealand ", "Customer_name": "Sch\u00f6gler Chris"}
