Saturday during half term. Gatwick airport very busy. Check-in in business class counter and fast track very efficient with minimal waiting. BA lounge overcrowded but good breakfast options and plenty of champagne. Priority boarding efficient. Seat comfortable with lots of space and sufficient recline for a day flight. Food from club world menu very tasty (fillet steak), child's meal very good. Plenty of drinks rounds during the flight and staff very pleasant, polite and helpful. Entertaining system ok with reasonably good choice of films. Flight one hour late which meant no queues in Barbados. Overall a very good flight with an incredibly good value for money (tickets were purchased during the BA sale). Thoroughly recommended.", "air_title": "British Airways ", "Customer_name": "Paul Karagounis"}
