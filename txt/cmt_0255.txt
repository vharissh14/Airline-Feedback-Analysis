Flew Manchester to LAX via Heathrow on Christmas day in Club World on the A380. Check in and boarding were extremely smooth at Manchester and the lounge was also quiet due to the fact it was a holiday.Upon arrival LHR was much busier, so much so that we struggled to find a seat in the south lounge. When it came time to board the aircraft it was, quite frankly, carnage. There didn't seem to be any real system and we had to fight through the crowds just to be able to get in the (long) line for Club passengers. The downside of such a big aircraft is the number of passengers, even in Club world. Once on board it was a fairly standard offering, Club World on BA is pretty consistent across all aircraft I now find. Seat and service were all fine, not exceptional but acceptable. My one main gripe us that we were seated on the lower deck (seats 13A and 13B) and on our side of the plane there was only one tiny bathroom, which often led to a line. The other side of the aircraft had two bathrooms but getting to them meant going all the way round the galley kitchen and cabin staff in there were often busy working or just hanging out and it seemed that they weren't too keen on being disturbed. Whilst there's no doubt the A380 is a quieter aircraft I feel its size and the number of passengers takes something away from the level of service, which you'd expect to be high given the price paid for Club World tickets.", "air_title": "British Airways ", "Customer_name": "M Gibson"}
