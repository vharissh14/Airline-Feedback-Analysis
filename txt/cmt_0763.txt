Very poor food even by economy standards. Inflight entertainment system did not work well, choice of classical music weighted towards modern composers. The only saving grace was the cabin crew. Lufthansa used to be a good airline, but these days it's more like a discounter charging legacy prices. Avoid it if you can.", "air_title": "Lufthansa ", "Customer_name": "Kovacs Charles"}
