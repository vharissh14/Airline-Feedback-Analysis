On a flight NZ134 on 6th February I was made to feel very much a second class citizen because we had chosen the lesser option of no food/movies etc. A choice we made because we prefer not to eat food on flight. The attendant was coming around collecting everyone's dinner remains when 'she' reached rudely across to grab my water glass in its container. I said ' oh I would like another glass of water please'. She took the glass, said there had been a medical emergency on board which I was aware of and that they were to busy. That was okay until the next lady in the row directly in front of me turned and asked for another glass of wine and was served immediately. That was just so rude of the flight attendant. I was fuming and when another attendant came by later it didn't seem to be so difficult to get it. I wanted to express my anger but did realize that the emergency did probably upset the normal routines.", "air_title": "Air New Zealand ", "Customer_name": "C Honeybone"}
