I sat in Economy class together with my kids. The comfort was more or less unsatisfactory because of the space between the rows, the passengers around us and the service. Staff were not very friendly and motivating, all additional drinks had to be requested by ourselves and their presence in the cabin was very low. Seemed that they were more interested in talking than working. I am frequent traveler and spend thousands of Euros on LH tickets every year and have experienced the following: the prices have increased and the service and quality decreased. I do not feel or see any value for money.", "air_title": "Lufthansa ", "Customer_name": "Syska Matthias"}
