The cabin staff did not even bother to close the curtain separating business from economy throughout the entire flight, that tells you everything you need to know about Lufthansa's incredibly poor short haul domestic product. I had transferred from a long haul flight where I experienced the new business product which is excellent. I guess the business cabin on short European flights is used mainly by connecting long haul business class passengers - surely nobody would actually pay to fly business on only a short haul flight, at least not on LH group carriers.", "air_title": "Lufthansa ", "Customer_name": "D Moore"}
