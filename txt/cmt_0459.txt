Booking done from site www.britishairways.com and the check-in too. The time boarding was done with great quality in Terminal 5 in Heathrow airport (pier C, gate 65) and schedule. Cabin crew was fantastic. The flight was very good, the quality of the plane provides an excellent trip. Takeoff and landing very smooth. The \"rest position\" of the seats makes, in upper deck, the legroom a little tight. Do not choose the emergency exit seats because they do not have access to windows and are narrower because the table and the monitor are on the armrest. JNB-LHR. 747-400. It is a much older plane. However the trip was very good after crossing the storm just outside Johannesburg.", "air_title": "British Airways ", "Customer_name": "A Cotrim"}
