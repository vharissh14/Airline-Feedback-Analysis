Seat comfort: The aircraft was an A330-300. I had a window seat. Foot space was ridiculously small as two metal boxes of about 10 cm width each were fixed to the legs of the seat in front of me. Every window seat seemed to have that feature. This makes a long haul flight very uncomfortable. Inflight entertainment: The touch screen took ages to react or was so sensitive or insensitive that I never knew whether I had pressed it correctly or not. The rest was fine.", "air_title": "Lufthansa ", "Customer_name": "Kristine Schaefer"}
