Excellent flight on fairly new B777-300, out leg very good in Premium Economy. Cabin crew outstanding both legs, food excellent. Both flights ahead of schedule. Only small negative comment would be onboard entertainment, particularly the movies, none of which I would describe as mainstream. Nevertheless would not hesitate to recommend ANZ. Well done to them!", "air_title": "Air New Zealand ", "Customer_name": "D N Chalmers"}
