We then flew on from Auckland to San Francisco using Premium Economy Class which we thought was excellent. The new style seats were very spacious and well laid out (perhaps the seat could have slid forward a bit more?). Good service; good food and a superb range of movies and TV channels etc., made for a comfortable relaxing flight and other airlines could do worse than copy this benchmark. I would recommend this service.", "air_title": "Air New Zealand ", "Customer_name": "David McKerchar"}
