Asking for a drink was a complete siege after 2 hours into the flight they claim that they had run out of galley drink supplies. On our return trying to obtain a refund for the pre booked seats proved difficult. Overall B.A. has got to rank as one of the worst airlines to travel with, staff with generally poor and indifferent attitudes, penny pinching which is bordering on mean and poor legroom. Sad to say this B.A but Emirates and other airlines put our national airline to absolute shame.", "air_title": "British Airways ", "Customer_name": "Derek Bavaird"}
