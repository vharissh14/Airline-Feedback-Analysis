The first leg with Singapore Airlines and the second sector with Air New Zealand. I have travelled a lot in the last 10 years and had not been on Air New Zealand for about 5 years. What has happened? After Singapore Airlines it was like travelling on a budget airline. No inflight information at all, no screen as it was broken, awful food. Apart from one staff member it seemed too much trouble to do anything for anyone. I had a young mother next to me travelling with 2 young children, the staff did not come near and the children's meal that arrived was turned down by a hungry and disappointed 4 year old. For our meal, wine, food and coffee was all served together in a rush to get it over it seemed. If I can help it I will never fly with them again. There was much talk as luggage was picked up by many passengers who were shocked at the very expensive flight they had just taken and the standard of service. I felt embarrassed by our National Airline.", "air_title": "Air New Zealand ", "Customer_name": "M Cable"}
