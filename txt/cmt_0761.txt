Short flight from London to Frankfurt satisfactory with good snack and drink, pleasant attendants. Transfer at Frankfurt seamless to the A380 to Johannesburg - gone are the days of long walks through the lengthy corridors of Frankfurt. Very comfortable seats and service on A380. Cabin crew very responsive and friendly. Food satisfactory. Return was CPT-MUC-LHR. A340-600 from Cape Town - plane not crowded so good service again with satisfactory food and drinks. Attendants served beverages throughout the night. Seats were comfortable all round. Minimal fuss and no problems with delays - all flights on time. Very good long haul flight. Short hop from Munich to London was good as well with breakfast snack served, just right for this length. IFE can have more up to date movies and music but small price to sacrifice.", "air_title": "Lufthansa ", "Customer_name": "G Slater"}
