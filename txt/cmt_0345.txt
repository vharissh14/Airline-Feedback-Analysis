The First class lounge at T5 was fairly busy but we managed to get a table in the dining area for a late breakfast. My eggs benedict was a poor second to my friends self serve full English. We boarded straight away and magazines, hot towels and menus were offered before push back. Drinks and nuts were served before lunch. The crew serving the right hand aisle were excellent. Band 4 meal consisting of a salad, choice of 2 mains and cheese or dessert. My chicken supreme was excellent, served with gnocchi. Drinks refills always at hand. An excellent flight. Well done BA.", "air_title": "British Airways ", "Customer_name": "Worcester David"}
