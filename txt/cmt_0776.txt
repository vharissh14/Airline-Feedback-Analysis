Initial outward flight delayed due to crew 'being stuck in traffic', although all passengers were waiting at the gate on time (it was a full flight). Standard of slimline seating on Lufthansa flights not comfortable at all (way too hard even for relatively short flights). Cabin crew pleasant and drinks / snacks ok. On return journey Lufthansa had another delayed flight back to Manchester with plenty of seats still available that would have got me home much earlier than my booked flight, but their 'customer service' staff in Munich wouldn't entertain allowing me on it, that would be far too helpful for them. All in all nothing special for the price, far too inflexible / not focussed on customers and I'll avoid Lufthansa in future for that reason.", "air_title": "Lufthansa ", "Customer_name": "A Bland"}
