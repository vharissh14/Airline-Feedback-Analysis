New Business Class has finally arrived in most of the LH planes. In general, I like the 180d-flat seat, biggest drawback compared to other good business seats is the missing space for e.g. a laptop adjacent to the seat which superior seats from their other brands OS/LX offer you, so you always have to use the foldaway table instead. Despite a fully booked C service was very efficient, crew very attentive (and professional as always on LH). Entertainment screen is top of shelf. Plane was a little late and some people that had tight connection flights were fetched directly after arrival, which is the efficiency LH is known for.", "air_title": "Lufthansa ", "Customer_name": "W Michael"}
