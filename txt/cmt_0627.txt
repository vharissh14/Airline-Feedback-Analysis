All flights on 777-300 with herring pattern arranged \u201cspace-seats\u201d in business (and eco+?). All flights on time. Aircraft clean, staff neat, and all flights on time. Food good. Lounges very good in all three airports visited. Only the lounge staff could improve. On board the planes a similar attitude: FAs appear to be very local, somehow managing to disrespect passengers by being by far too familiar, and too self- confident doing too much talking for nothing and on the verge of being intrusive. All FAs (except a single one) were clearly ageing, over the hill, and that shows. Order details were forgotten during the lengthy chat sessions which at times were embarrassing or painful. On the outbound I had 13 hours transit in AKL and no hotel was provided as this was a regular schedule time gap! They also managed not to reload my bag to NAD and it remained in AKL. Arrived 28 hours later to Suva upon filling forms and lots of confusion and phone calls.", "air_title": "Air New Zealand ", "Customer_name": "Anders Pedersen"}
