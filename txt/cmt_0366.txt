Quick check-in, good boarding, sandwich wasn't the best 'evening meal' I have ever had but adequate on a short flight. Good crew. Exemplary crew on return flight. Nice airbus with comfy leather seats. Both flights on time/slightly early.", "air_title": "British Airways ", "Customer_name": "J Tydeman"}
