My travel partner couldn't have his meal choice fulfilled on-board twice! FRA-BLR and on the return leg BLR-FRA. The seats on the new B-748 were comfortable, however my personal reading light did not function and I could not get the wifi access. There was enough space and more than enough to eat on board. The return leg was on an old B-744. The seats were not as comfortable as the newer aircraft and the IFE system was a bit limited regarding film and TV selection.", "air_title": "Lufthansa ", "Customer_name": "J Comissiong"}
