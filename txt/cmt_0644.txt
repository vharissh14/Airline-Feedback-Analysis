The crew on both flights were extremely polite and kind. On the VCE to FRA flight we had to wait in the aircraft for around 45 minutes due to problems with snow in Frankfurt. Some people were worried that they would miss their connecting flights but the crew and flight attendants kept us informed about all delays and changes. I got my flight to Dublin on time and it also had a slight delay. I have flown with Lufthansa most of my life and I am very satisfied with the airline. The food however is like with all other European and American airliners if you fly on an economy class ticket.", "air_title": "Lufthansa ", "Customer_name": "Crowther Alexander"}
