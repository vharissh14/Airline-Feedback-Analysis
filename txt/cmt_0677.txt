My first time in Premium Economy and it's been fantastic! Its not as cheap as Economy Plus on United, but you can't compare that! Far more leg space, fantastic seats where you can nearly lay down as in Business Class, food and drinks served with style and great taste! For my next trip I will book Premium Economy for sure. It's 100% worth it!", "air_title": "Lufthansa ", "Customer_name": "Di Mugno Michael"}
