Well a great service as usual and we actually arrived on time for once, 5 minutes ahead of schedule, that is a miracle for London Heathrow! The only thing about British Airways is that they only do one drinks service, I am sure two is far more appreciative as I know other scheduled airline services do more than one on a 2hr flight. Tea/Coffee only gets offered a poor once. But great flight all in all!", "air_title": "British Airways ", "Customer_name": "Shoesmith Michael"}
