I was seated in the same seat 16k both ways. My main problem was that by the time they got to me for each meal time whatever I had chosen off the menu they had run out of or there had been a mistake and they didn't have the meals that were on the menu. Often I would have to call out to them for a drink as they seemed to forget that there was another seat. In the morning because I am diabetic I had to go to the front and ask for something to eat which was hard as most people where sleeping and I didn't want to disturb anyone.", "air_title": "British Airways ", "Customer_name": "Karen James"}
