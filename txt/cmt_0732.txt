First flight was LH-2501 from Manchester to Munich in an Airbus A321. No entertainment screens, but this was only a two hour flight so I didn't mind. However, the staff service was excellent and I got served a decent sandwich plus coffee and coke. Seats were okay for the short flight. Transferred at Munich Airport, which was very neat and clean, with a good bus ride from the plane to the terminal. The next flight, LH-608 from Munich to Riyadh in an Airbus A330 (five hours), was the real deal! Seats weren't exactly the most comfortable out of all planes I've been on, but it was good enough! Entertainment screens were quite unresponsive and not much of my interest, but I have my iPod so I didn't mind. Managed to watch 2 episodes of Big Bang Theory and my sister watched Harry Potter (she was really happy that there were 5 Harry Potter movies available on the flight). Again, excellent staff service (they smiled a lot for an added bonus) and I was surprised to get a really tasty meal (with Halal meat). Really well done for a non-middle-eastern airline! I felt completely relaxed throughout the flight!", "air_title": "Lufthansa ", "Customer_name": "Ayman Ilham"}
