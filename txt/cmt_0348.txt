British Airways has invented \"High Density Business Class\" or \"Sardines Business Class\". 8 abreast on the main deck and 7 abreast on the upper deck, this cabin configuration is very strange. To be fair, the seat itself is comfortable enough to be able to sleep, but it is so narrow that you have almost nothing to store any belongings. You are facing your neighbour, and if you seat on a middle seat, the access to the aisle is not easy at all. You have no view outside except if you have a window seat. You have the impression of flying in a submarine! On the other hand, if you are a little bit claustrophobic, fly the competitors. The IFE is OK, the screen is large enough, but the film selection is under average. The service is good, food and beverage OK. To summarize, as long as BA proposes (very) attractive fare (that was the case) I will fly again BA, if not, I will fly the competitors.", "air_title": "British Airways ", "Customer_name": "Eric Martin"}
