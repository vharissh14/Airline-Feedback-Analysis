Outward flight delayed 2 hours due to unloading a bag and technical problems on the ground. Flight completely full, upgraded to Club World. Cabin crew there excellent and attentive. Seat comfort was OK but not special. Food was good. One very small toilet next to the pilot door for Club World passengers. Terminal 1 on its last legs but check in was quick. Return trip was in Economy-what a difference!", "air_title": "British Airways ", "Customer_name": "D Taylor"}
