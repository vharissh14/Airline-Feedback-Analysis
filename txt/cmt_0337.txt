Our flight was cancelled in Philadelphia due to mechanical problems. They put us up in a quality hotel, gave us meal vouchers and kept us informed of the flight status, gave us an extra day at the hotel since it was a late flight. I missed my connection to Dubai had to wait at Heathrow for 6 hrs. Missed 2 days of work, but can't get angry they did all they could and would fly BA again.", "air_title": "British Airways ", "Customer_name": "Ronca David"}
