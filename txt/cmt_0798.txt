Consistently reliable, friendly and courteous staff. Cabin in reasonable condition. Very happy to fly Lufthansa on this route. We also flew return MUC-YVR, LH476/7 on the same dates. Outbound 26 August. Inbound 23 September. The business class seats were fine, we were in rows 4 and 11. For me row 4 was far more private. Seats fine but not as good as Qatar's 777 flights. Comfortable, reclining and flat for overnight. Slept reasonably well. I'd do this again at the right price. Food fine with reasonable variety. Staff efficient without being engaging, whereas staff on the Manchester leg were more friendly and charming on both flights than the long haul crew. Overall happy with experience but do think the long haul staff should be more engaging.", "air_title": "Lufthansa ", "Customer_name": "Fraser Ann"}
