This last 3 months I have flown from Auckland to Los Angeles, last month on Virgin, this week on Air New Zealand. The problem flying Virgin is that I need a stop in Sydney, having said that, the fare is a good price, the service between Auckland and Sydney, and Sydney and Los Angeles was good - very good. On the return I had to fly Virgin to Sydney but an Air New Zealand code share between Sydney and AKL, that was the down part of the journey. Narrow seats, tatty aircraft, pay for a meal, pay for everything - the complete opposite of the similar virgin segment on the outward journey. I figured it was because it was a transtasman that Air New Zealand treat passengers like cattle and nickel and dime them, but this last trip I decided to go Auckland-LAX direct. Air New Zealand charge $300 more than their rivals, you get 1 bag, unlike Virgin where you get 2, the plane is dirty, the cabin crew are ok, a couple were a little off hand to the person in the seat beside me, no blanket, no eye cover, no little pack of toothpaste. I guess for me it was just a disappointment, I thought they were better and I remember a few years ago they were, now they are just a budget airline that charge a premium price based on a past reputation. I will continue to use them for speed, but if I have time, I would choose Virgin Australia or Qantas.", "air_title": "Air New Zealand ", "Customer_name": "Peter Hendry"}
