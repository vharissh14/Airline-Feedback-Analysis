Check in - Directed to Club World check in. One of our bags not labelled with First Priority label. A little annoying as on the way out all First luggage was the very last off the carousel. Boarding was via gate 2 and then through World Traveller Plus section. Again annoying as that happened with boarding and disembarking on the way out. Electrical problems with entertainment and lighting - resolved after two hours. No First amenity bags on board. No sleep suit offered as not on board either. Seat for buddy dining kept collapsing. As it was the 1st of the month new wine list available. After one glass of Mersault there was no more on board. Offered 2 of last months whites as an alternative. Butter at breakfast was rancid. Needn't have worried about the bag without the priority label. It came of before our other bags! Again First luggage came through long after most of the other classes of travel had cleared the baggage hall. We did disembark through door 1, however. Crew pleasant and apologetic. Why do we pay the extra? It's back to Club World for us. Time to start trying other airlines as well.", "air_title": "British Airways ", "Customer_name": "Hugh Harkness"}
