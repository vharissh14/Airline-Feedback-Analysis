For health reasons, my wife needs a wheelchair as she has trouble walking. We requested a wheelchair for her at the Newark, Frankfurt and Chennai airports. Everything was fine in Newark NJ. However, when she arrived at Frankfurt, no wheelchair was provided. Lufthansa staff advised her there was no wheelchair and to walk slowly. When my wife told them she can hardly walk and carry the carry-on luggage, they ignored her. Finally, one Lufthansa staff walked her to the bus to the next flights terminal, but she did not help in any way. Seeing my wife\u2019s inability to move the carry-on, another kind passenger helped her. When she arrived at her terminal, she had to wait for the cart to drive her to her gate. Lufthansa staff needs to be trained in customer service, especially service to individuals who need assistance. These flights are not inexpensive, and there is no excuse for this type of rude and incompetent service.", "air_title": "Lufthansa ", "Customer_name": "Andal Raghavan"}
