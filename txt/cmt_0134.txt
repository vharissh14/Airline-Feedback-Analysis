Awful from booking to completion of the flight. As a BA. Gold executive member at time of booking some 11 months ago booked this flight on the new A380, only to be told by BA in May 2014 the equipment had been changed to the extremely old 744 due to technical issues. Sold feeling a little let down secured seats 1a and 2a on the 744 these are the best of a bad bunch as to I wonder why BA squeezes 14 seats into such a small area where other airlines only fit 8 seats into the front sections of 744s'. At the beginning of March I checked the booking online only to find that we had been moved to row 5 in the middle, this was not acceptable. I called the BA gold line to object only to be given numerous contradicting excuses non of which were valid, whilst on the flight I found out that the passenger in 1a was a lifetime gold member so. I can only assume that rank has its privileges. Now onto the flight, arrogant staff with one exception, really poor food served at different times as we were in the middle which meant we had different staff attending to us. Plane interior shabby not surprised for a 20 plus year old plane along with the PA being inaudible, I felt this to be a safety issue and when mentioned I was ignored. I booked this flight for us a part of a special Far East holiday, I had high expectations of BA First which have not been met in anyway, what a total waste of money. Will now try to avoid flying BA in any of there classes once I have redeemed my Avios balance.", "air_title": "British Airways ", "Customer_name": "Christopher Willett"}
