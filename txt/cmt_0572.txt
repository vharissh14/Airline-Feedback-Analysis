My husband and I flew Air New Zealand to the United States in May. Having flown various airlines before Air New Zealand is right up there with the best. The service given by their more mature staff was exceptional compared with other airlines who use a younger cabin crew. The only reason I rate the satisfaction of my trip 9/10 is that they code share with United who must come bottom of my list (the trip with United between New York and Los Angeles the worst I have ever had). If you fly Air New Zealand to the United States organize your onward trip yourself so that you can avoid flying United.", "air_title": "Air New Zealand ", "Customer_name": "Annette Nyst"}
