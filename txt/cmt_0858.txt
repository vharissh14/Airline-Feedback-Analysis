Flight out of FRA was delayed. The seats are like camping folding chairs. Very uncomfortable! Fortunately only a short haul flight. One out of three bathrooms not fully operational on a fully booked flight. The purser confirmed that she was aware of the bathroom situation and that she had already two prior flights on the same aircraft that day. During beverage service, same purser opened a bottle of sparkling wine mid cabin and showered three rows of guests plus the interior. There was sparkling wine dripping off the ceiling and the overhead bins for the next 15 min. Highly unprofessional! All in all not acceptable.", "air_title": "Lufthansa ", "Customer_name": "P Ries"}
