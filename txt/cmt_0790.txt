Out-dated and worn business class seats. Possible to recline fully, but narrow. Really close to non-existent service. Despite few passengers in business class very slow and inattentive service. After initial take-off beverages no more drink service of water or anything else. Food quality like in a cheap charter flight. No one of the staff bothered to serve a quick breakfast to those passengers who wanted to sleep a bit longer, not even a cup of coffee.", "air_title": "Lufthansa ", "Customer_name": "Olle Olerup"}
