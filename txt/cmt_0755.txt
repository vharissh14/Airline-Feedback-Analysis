The flight from Edinburgh to Frankfurt was perfect on time with great in-flight service. As it arrived earlier than the scheduled time, we were transported to the terminal by a bus. The second leg from Frankfurt to Zurich was delayed by 45 minutes due to an unknown reason. Again we were transported by a bus to the B737. Here is where the entire staff and crew showed their effectiveness. The flight duration was cut short to 40 min from the original 55 min. Even in such a short duration, we were offered chocolates and drinks. I could simple describe their service in one word \"excellent\".", "air_title": "Lufthansa ", "Customer_name": "Kris Mani"}
