During my trip to the UK, I feel very pleased that I chose BA. The A380 was superb. The new Thales inflight entertainment was more than excellent. There were 1250 hours of On Demand to choose from. Although the food was quite limited, I really liked the entertainment and the staff service. First class service in economy class!", "air_title": "British Airways ", "Customer_name": "Keung Kieron"}
