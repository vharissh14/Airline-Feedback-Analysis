Past experiences were very good, but this time it was very bad experience as far as entertainment, food and beverages are concerned. Asked Air-hostess to replace defective headset and told she would come back with replacement, which never happened. Secondly Drinks served only once, asked for another drink and was flatly refused. Asked for something for munching with drinks, was told its finished and the most surprising part is after completion of all services when I opted to go for wash room was amazed to see team leader eating the snacks that I was told is finished. Food of average quality. Looks like the standard has reached the lowest level.", "air_title": "Jet Airways ", "Customer_name": "Bhambhani Manoj Nanik"}
