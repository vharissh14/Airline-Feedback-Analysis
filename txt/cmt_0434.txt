Just returned from a London - Toronto - London flight. BA appear to be proud of their new \"Dreamliner\" but they have scored a real own-goal by cramming 9 seats into each row, 3+3+3. The only way this has been achieved is by fitting seats that are far narrower than the norm. We are well used to airlines having unjustifiably uncomfortable seat pitch but this was the first time I have found myself wedged into such a narrow seat - and I am quite slimly-built! Unless BA changes their 787s to a less-cramped layout I will now have no alternative but to make sure I am not flying in a 787, thus often avoiding BA altogether. I will let a BA steward have the last word: \"The first time I sat in one of these seats I could not believe how bad they are\" - and he, like me, is slim. Come on BA - start having a little regard for your customers' comfort and health.", "air_title": "British Airways ", "Customer_name": "J Martin"}
