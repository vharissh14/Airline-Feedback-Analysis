The portion from Frankfurt to Doha was on an Airbus A330 with the new business class which was very nice and excellent service with wonderful meal selection, I really liked the Bavarian Goose. Though the connection time was very short just one hour but all our bags made it through which was also very nice.", "air_title": "Lufthansa ", "Customer_name": "A Althani"}
