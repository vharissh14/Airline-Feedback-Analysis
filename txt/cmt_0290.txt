We found the seats comfortable and the window seat was private with plenty of storage, my wife found the reverse to be true of the aisle seat, getting out of the window seat is quite tricky. We found the food to be quite tasty. We had the beef tenderloin for dinner which was cooked nicely and tasted very good. The cooked English breakfast was also good. The plane was clean and new looking and the toilets were clean and fresh. Staff service, on the whole was reasonable, however they did very little other than the main meal services, also the head FA was particularly unfriendly, bordering on rude. Will we fly BA again after our return on the 23/1/15? Maybe, if they are considerably cheaper, or Cathay Pacific are full.", "air_title": "British Airways ", "Customer_name": "R Simpson"}
