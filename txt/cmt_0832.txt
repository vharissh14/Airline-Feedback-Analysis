Flight left Stockholm on time. Professional and friendly crew. Aircraft had new space saver seats with a 30 inch seat pitch, which for a 6 ft guy was comfortable. Lufthansa provided a pizza snack and beverages (including alcohol) on this flight. Transfer at Frankfurt was only an hour, but travelling from a schengen to a non schengen country was a breeze, despite the long walk. Second flight similar to first. Arrived in Manchester on time. Would recommend Lufthansa.", "air_title": "Lufthansa ", "Customer_name": "Sean McCarthy"}
