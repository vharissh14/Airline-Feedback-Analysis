The flight was operated by Lufthansa's CITY LINE with an E195. I love this aircraft. The crew to Toulouse were very nice and happy to passengers, opposite on the way back. Presented themselves a little arrogantly. The service was a sandwich and a drink service. Fine with me. However they served the exact same sandwich on the way back. I am happy, that Swiss will fly as of May 1, 2015 directly to TLS, so I don't have to fly to MUC to change.", "air_title": "Lufthansa ", "Customer_name": "R Thut"}
