Flight left on time and was 20 minutes shorter than planned. Seats were great and I had plenty of leg room (I am 6'5\"), I had an exit seat thinking there would be more but they were all the same on the A320. I was disappointed that I was not given a meal after paying for a full fare ticket, and therefore had to purchase snacks (most of which had sold out already which is highly frustrating). Inflight entertainment was also not included, this was $10 per movie which I thought was extremely overpriced! Luckily I put some things on my phone to watch. Some staff were friendly, some not so. Free water/tea/coffee - but you get that on any airline. Overall happy but there could be improvements.", "air_title": "Air New Zealand ", "Customer_name": "M Eggleton"}
