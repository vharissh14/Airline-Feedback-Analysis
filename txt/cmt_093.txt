The staff in the airport were not proactive. They were not explaining the problems and we had to keep going to the desk to ask on if there were further delays (started as 3 hours delayed, and then was subsequently moved out by 30 min increments). On the way back, the Amritsar to Delhi flight was delayed by 20 mins and passport control in Delhi is poor cumbersome and slow (only 3 staff for 6 counters). The Jet Airways staff were randomly pushing some passengers up the queue to the annoyance of other Jet Airways passengers on the same flight and Air India passengers too. In the end, I had to run to gate for boarding due to incompetence.", "air_title": "Jet Airways ", "Customer_name": "Johal Tarlochan"}
