If you want to know what Ryanair long haul will be like sit in E on the BA 787. Appalling legroom, seat width and non functioning IFE. Gold Card holder flying around 200 trips a year. Absolutely horrendous experience, good luck to anyone taking the 12hr+ trip to Chengdu on it! New plane with the smallest seats ever. Many passengers tried to stand the entire trip to avoid the discomfort! If you are anything more than a medium build and have a bum and hips you will have a very uncomfortable flight. I am not one to moan, but this is the end for me BA!", "air_title": "British Airways ", "Customer_name": "G Boyle"}
