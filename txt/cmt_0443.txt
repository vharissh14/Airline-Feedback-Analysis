In short, an abomination for a business class flight lasting nearly 4 hours. It started with a dirty, dingy, cramped lounge, with very limited and low-quality food and drink selection, and located very far from the boarding gates. I have used the Star Alliance lounge at Ataturk Airport, and it is light years ahead of the BA lounge. The plane was an ancient B767. The business class seats had little leg room or recline, were packed out, hard and very uncomfortable. It took 1 hour for any drink or food service to start, and we were served warm champagne and a small bag of stale nuts. This was followed by a hot meal which was totally different from that described in the menu which had been handed out, and this became apparent only when the food service began. There were only two choices, nothing vegetarian. The crew were disengaged, disinterested and dismissive. The entertainment system consisted of only several old screens suspended from the ceiling and showing the movie Godzilla, which doubtless was a big hit with the 12 year olds in the audience. At the end of the flight, we were given fast-track cards to speed up our passage through customs. Unfortunately, only 3 of the 6 fast-track booths were open, and we ended up effectively in the slow-track line. To add insult to injury, this business class flight cost $200 more than that of its competitor, Turkish Airlines, and bore little resemblance to the business class service and cabin described on the BA website. Shame on British Airways for this product.", "air_title": "British Airways ", "Customer_name": "F Klajner"}
