I flew the 747-800 and was really impressed with the new Business. I sat downstairs and had a seat in the middle section where every seat is an aisle. Spacious and comfortable. All flight attendants are gracious - would not say so much that the food was any better than UAL. In fact, their little mousse dessert was nothing compared to UAL's Ice Cream sundaes. On Lufthansa they gave us a small tin for the amenity kit. The toilets are well stocked with amenities. Inflight entertainment on the new 747-800 was exceptional. So many choices. The return flight from Munich was delayed due to a broken aircraft. We left about 2.5 hours late from MUC. They offered everyone food vouchers and handled the delay very well. While the old Business Class seating on this A340-600 is not at all as nice as the New BC - it was ok. The crew were exceptionally friendly and very careful to make sure that everyone was taken care of.", "air_title": "Lufthansa ", "Customer_name": "W Campbell"}
