On this flight British Airways stinted on everything. I don't mind a frugal airline as long as the fare is cheap. British Airways is not cheap. As soon as we were in the air the temperature plummeted. Everyone had their airline blankets over them. There were not enough stewards/stewardesses. Forty minutes before the welcome on board drink - and no small snack, not even a small packet of nuts. Seatback TV did not work in the section I was on, and the man next to me had to move to another seat. The seatbacks should be checked before the flight. However eventually they did work. A small number of films, TV shows I have never heard of, and no games option. First meal very frugal, second meal, no salad, and no bread roll. And creamers! Even for tea! Whatever the quality of the meal, serving creamers cancels out any pretence of quality. Snacks, we had to wait, and when they were available, there was a limited amount. British Airways even ran out of beer! BA hasa system of paying to book a certain seat, they don't miss a trick! I resent having to pay to book a certain seat. The flight was expensive, but it had a good time slot and no stopover. Never again.", "air_title": "British Airways ", "Customer_name": "P Brennan"}
