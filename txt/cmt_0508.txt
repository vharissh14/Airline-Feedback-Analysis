Paid for \"works\". Awful (dry) food which lack any imagination, water served in plastic cups, no inflight magazine, no sick bags, no head phones so had to wait for them to arrive before I could use the entertainment system. The entertainment system had very limited selection of movies, scrolling between screens was slow to navigate and the whole thing seemed counter-intuitive. When on Emirates you get an entertainment guide/magazine which allows you to view the selection of movies at a glance, with Air NZ you need to slowly scroll through each page of movies. Hostesses rather than being professional were trying to be too friendly/familiar - the \"kiwi\" way does not automatically equate to being professional. Really poor work Air NZ, regret using you.", "air_title": "Air New Zealand ", "Customer_name": "D C Dean"}
