It's a mediocre flight from London to Frankfurt however the flight parked at the gate they did not use the finger, instead passengers were all expected to get out at the rear of the aircraft and take a bus ride to another part of the airport (this seems to happen a lot with Lufthansa flights from London to Berlin and Dusseldorf too). After an involuntary tour of the airport I battled my way through security, customs and immigration to get to the Hanover gate only to find the plane had gone. To my way of thinking, this represents \"mis-selling\" as there is no way anyone is ever going to make the advertised connection in 30 minutes (not at Frankfurt anyway). Perhaps Lufthansa regard English passengers as \"under-people\". To add salt to my wounds, Lufthansa made no apologies and just bumped me onto the next flight four hours later. I complained again at Frankfurt customer service, which was a log wait amongst the flotsam and jetsam, but was only offered a \u20ac10 coffee voucher which I declined as an insult. I can only assume that Lufthansa is now competing with German Wings for the most miserable service. Try and leave a comment on Lufthansa's web page and they actually believe people still use fax machines.", "air_title": "Lufthansa ", "Customer_name": "T Wynne-Jones"}
