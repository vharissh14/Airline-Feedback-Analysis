New Boeing 747-8 in economy - you get what you paid for I always say - but due to my unpleasant experience, below some observations that should be taken into consideration. Seats are extremely uncomfortable and the given space on the 747-8 feels incredibly cramped - Lufthansa's smaller airplanes are controversially far more spacious - I get they want to squeeze in as many passengers on the plane, but on a +12 hrs flight you don't want to feel like a sardine in a can! Hostesses not attentive in general. In the future I will rather fly with Lufthansa's sister company Swiss Airlines which I personally find of a much better service.", "air_title": "Lufthansa ", "Customer_name": "Jens Praet"}
