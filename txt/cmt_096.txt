We took a total of 5 flights with Jet. All flights had one thing in common and that was the cabin crew who were the unfriendliest and least professional crew I have encountered in over 30 years of flying. They made no safety checks before we left Heathrow (children were sitting on parents laps with no safety harness), did not smile and threw food and drink at you.. Seats were tiny, in fairness to Jet, our flights arrived largely on time and safely. The fares were cheap, but I would have paid more to get a better service.", "air_title": "Jet Airways ", "Customer_name": "Louise Ryan"}
