I was lucky enough to book a window seat at the back of the club world cabin which meant that I had direct aisle access without stepping over someone else's feet, or them mine, and my meals did not need to be passed over the person next to me. I found the seat very comfortable, and while it is slightly narrower than others it has a lot of flexibility with the foot stool and the reclining options. The backward/forward facing seats is not ideal, although did not upset me as much as others. As I was travelling with a friend, the potentially awkward intimacy was not an issue. IFE was excellent with a large, good quality screen and an extensive library of films and TV. Food was fairly disappointing, possibly hindered by an hour delay on departure, although really they should be resilient to that. Drinks and service were both very good, British Airways offer a very efficient and professional service although it is not always overtly friendly. Personally I like this, but it could be seen as a negative depending on peoples expectations. Galleries Lounge in LHR T5 was excellent. Peaceful and comfortable with a good selection of drinks and reasonable food. Overall it was a solid product, and one which I look forward to flying again. BA do need to improve their catering on board in order to compete better with other airlines.", "air_title": "British Airways ", "Customer_name": "C Down"}
