New inflight entertainment with rich variety of movies and music. However, the sound volume was far too low for enjoying the acoustics. Seats in Economy improved. Best of all, however: very clean washrooms during the entire 10.5 hr flight. Flight attendants went in with gloves quite frequently. Food in economy class was ok, I always pre-book Asian Vegetarian, which seems to be a \"winner\": tasty and sufficient.", "air_title": "Lufthansa ", "Customer_name": "Fargel Matthias"}
