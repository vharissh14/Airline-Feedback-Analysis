One leg of the flight was with Jet Airways. The flight was delayed due to fog and the KLM connecting flight left. There was no Jet airways representative at the airport to resolve our travel problems. The travel desk required Jet airways to authorize the rebooking since they caused the delay. The local representative arrived after 6 hours. The arrangements were so poor at Abu Dhabi airport that there were hundreds of passengers who had missed the flight due to Jet airways from various destinations were left without any help for many hours. I managed to get my tickets sorted after being in a queue for 8 hours. I have never had such a bad experience in 15 years of flying. They should not be flying international routes as the quality of backup is very poor and no one at Abu Dhabi was taking any responsibility of sorting the passengers problems for many hours.", "air_title": "Jet Airways ", "Customer_name": "S Thomas"}
