I was disabled this particular trip with a dislocated knee. I was flying Business class and had already placed a special assistance request at the time of booking the ticket. i was also a Jet airways frequent flyer. My experience was so bad / awful that I never want to travel this airline ever again. There was no assistance provided. The wheelchair took forever to come at the Delhi airport. The person pushing the wheelchair left me in the lounge and disappeared. When final call started being announced, my father had to push my wheelchair and carry the hand luggage to the flight. On flight and at check in when we asked them if a message had been sent to Singapore for a wheelchair to be available at the landing station, but the staff was rude and unhelpful. On flight they were even worse! On the way back the staff at check in at Singapore said they could not get me a wheelchair and scoffed at me and my crutches and told me to walk. The immigration security officer saw me and asked me why I was not being assisted - he not only took me through immigration himself but arranged a Singapore Airport Authority person to get a wheelchair in 2 minutes and assist me.", "air_title": "Jet Airways ", "Customer_name": "P Dinodia"}
