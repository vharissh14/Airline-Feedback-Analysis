Video system was not working so attendant suggested using middle seat screen but aisle seat passenger had to use it as his audio was not working. After waiting 30 mins turns out it was working but no one bothered to advise me it had been reset. Crew couldn't turn down overhead lights after meal and surprisingly comment cards never appeared for feedback. Sent an email 5 days ago & no response. 747 looked worn out.", "air_title": "Air New Zealand ", "Customer_name": "G Merrick"}
