Used the priority check-in for Star Alliance Gold and was served by a very efficient duo of agents. They moved me forward in the cabin and put me in a seat which had a good chance of having the neighbouring seat empty. It also provided extra legroom as it was in a transition row. Aircraft was spotless and bright and the pullback from the gate was on time. Service by FA's was efficient, professional and attentive. Two choices of main course was offered for dinner and the food quality was good for Economy. There were several drink rounds throughout the overnight flight and breakfast was served prior to landing. IFE was expansive and offered a great choice of recent movies and other entertainment. Bathrooms were spacious, bright and kept clean. Seats were as comfortable as one can expect in Economy and provided reasonable legroom. Flight arrived on time and we were kept informed by the captain at just the right points in the flight. Another great experience with Lufthansa, they seldom disappoint.", "air_title": "Lufthansa ", "Customer_name": "T Eldem"}
