I'm pleased that they've gone back to the Lord of the Rings safety video - grabs your attention much better than any other I've seen in recent years. Information from flight deck good apart from one sector, where the First Officer seemed to be whispering. No problems with the flights themselves - my only grizzle is about the automated check-in machines. On two of my Christchurch legs the machine wouldn't print a bag tag, so I had to join the long queue to get one from the manned counter. There also seemed to be some in both Auckland and Christchurch that weren't working.", "air_title": "Air New Zealand ", "Customer_name": "Chris McQuaid"}
