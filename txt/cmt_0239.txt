A brief trip to celebrate New Year in Honkers. Pleasant First class check in, average Fast Track and warm welcome in the Concorde Room. Escorted to a table for 3. Excellent meal and service. My salmon tartare was nice enough and the Lamb was very tender, rounded off by a sticky toffee and date pudding which was good, but next time, more clotted cream please. I enjoyed a couple of glasses of champagne and a nice pinot noir. Boarded at C64, escorted to my seat after a very warm personal welcome. Champagne, slippers, pj's and an amenity kit proffered. Crew seem excellent. They will also bring us home on New Year's day. After take off, drinks (bloody mary for me) and an amuse-bouche. My friends indulged in a full meal but I just had the Cauliflower Soup which was very tasty. My friend's Profiteroles looked yummy. The crew were very attentive to us all. After being taken on a tour of the 777 by Kim, I slept for 4 hours or so before indulging in a full English. Got changed before landing. An excellent flight with an excellent crew. Coming home. After a pleasant supper in the Qantas lounge, we were escorted to the front of the queue and welcomed on board by our, now familiar crew,. Champagne settled us down and after take off, my dinner was predicated with an amuse-bouche of beef carpaccio, prawn and balik salmon with olive oil caviar, followed by lamb washed down with a rather nice Medoc, with a cheese plate conclusion. After a good night's sleep, I woke to a cup of English Breakfast tea and orange juice whilst my friends had the full works. Quick disembarkation.
