First. T5 is great for the first class experience with check in, security and straight into the Concorde room. The lounge and spa facilities are a great refuge while flying especially the dining room. The 777 has more room in the cabin than the 747 flight to London which I appreciated especially when it came to my bed. Seat 2A is private and roomy. It was a full flight so service was efficient and friendly if not a little rushed. Overall the service was at the great BA standard. What was lacking was the meal was lacking the freshness and taste which was disappointing. There was major (1hr) delay in planing at JFK which was not BA's fault but really made this flight much longer than it should had been. I would fly BA First again for the service, stylish cabin and overall comfort.", "air_title": "British Airways ", "Customer_name": "S Adlam"}
