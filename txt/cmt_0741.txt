STR-FRA very long bus transport from parking area to terminal. Long walk in FRA to terminal C, nice lounge for waiting until boarding. Flight to GIG on 744, acceptable seating comfort. Food and drink offered were ok for economy. GRU-MUC on A346 in Business, good food, good service, seat not that comfortable this time - still some hours of rest. IFE some nice films but very limited selection. Final leg, MUC-STR very limited space in overhead bins - not even room for my hand luggage backpack. Luggage arrived one day later as it hadn't made connection in GRU.", "air_title": "Lufthansa ", "Customer_name": "Epple Frank"}
