Flight number VA7405. AKL airport and several Air NZ staff were unable to tell me where to check in despite it being an Air NZ flight. Screen confirmed check in at Gate A where I had been asking. Told to check in at kiosk but would only accept Air NZ flight number and my e-ticket only had VA flight number. Told by successive staff I must have been given Air NZ flight number, unwilling to help. Shoved e-ticket under the nose of the staff member who insisted I should know and said showed me where it states Air NZ flight number. He said it was NZ105. He could have said that 10 mins earlier. By the time I checked in the flight was boarding and I still had to get to the departure gate, through customs and to the boarding gate. Just made the plane and was told by Air NZ staff I should have checked in and moved to gate earlier. 1 hr 15 min to check in. Unacceptable. Onboard, having travelled 5 hours to the airport and the check in debacle I looked forward to a meal and movie. Told no meal, no movie. Uncomfortable seat that barely reclined. I fly Emirates and am used to a meal, tea, coffee, wine and the ICE entertainment system. One FA gave me movie access out of pity and I had to pay $10 for a sandwich. Emirates, please fly to Denpasar Bali so I never have to go through this again. Our national carrier is a disorganised disgrace.", "air_title": "Air New Zealand ", "Customer_name": "Brown Nyree"}
