At the check-in counter I paid an extra fee since my bag was heavier, but that was no problem. I asked if I could bring another hand-baggage but the answer was no. I felt ripped off when boarding I saw people with 3-4 bags each one, when allowed is 1. And moreover I couldn't put my bag over me but 5-10 meters behind me since there was no place where it was supposed to be, because a young couple had 2 backpacks, 2 bags and 2 sleeping bags. I spent 1000$ dollars and 150$ more for the fee and I had my worst flight because I was so pissed off. And at the airport I had to take the money at the atm paying commissions because the credit card machine didn't work.", "air_title": "Lufthansa ", "Customer_name": "M Gal"}
