My disappointment continues with BA on the A380 Club World seat. In theory being the flagship plane - it should have the flagship Business class seat. As a regular traveller with BA I know the \"Club\" product well and this seat is a lot more cramped than the older 777 product. What BA risk when they downsize a product is insulting the regular traveller whom, WILL notice, and take offence and fly with someone else. Its a bit like the BA First product, this used to have caviar on the JFK route and silver plated cutlery and Krug champagne. Now they don't. I notice because I used to experience it. Meanwhile prices have shot up - and quality has shot downwards. Very disappointing.", "air_title": "British Airways ", "Customer_name": "C Drake"}
