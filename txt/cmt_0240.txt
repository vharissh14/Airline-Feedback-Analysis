Check in was easy and very quick and we were soon in the lounge. The lounge as usual was comfortable but with a very poor selection of food. As we were there around 09.15 I had hoped to have a hot breakfast but in the end the only hot dish available was porridge, which I didn't fancy so we settled for tea and cakes. The departure gate was not the biggest and as a result, it all got a bit messy with the staff trying coral the CW passengers in to a separate area to board first. On board most things were OK and the staff are very efficient and helped to make the experience a good one. The return from Kingston was pretty much the same although the check in was slower. However, this was compensated by an excellent lounge (Club Kingston) that served nice hot and cold snacks and then escorted you to the departure area. As usual the crew turned the lights down as soon as dinner was cleared away, but I did manage to read for a while and then sleep for 3 to 4 hours. Overall quite good and based on this experience, I would recommend this product.", "air_title": "British Airways ", "Customer_name": "Ian Robinson"}
