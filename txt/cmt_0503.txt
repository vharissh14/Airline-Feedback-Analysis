Staff service fair, food (veg option) very poor, entertainment tired, especially movies on offer. London catering needs attention. Big contrast with inward journey 15.1.15 where staff were very good, veg option (ex LA) tasty with lots of fresh veg and fruit, inflight entertainment also good.", "air_title": "Air New Zealand ", "Customer_name": "Nancy Wilson"}
