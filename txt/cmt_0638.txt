I knew the product would be inferior to the 777-300 and 747 ones, but still it is a relief to have much more legroom and better catering. Check in at NRT was a breeze, and the ANA lounge (as I have Air NZ Elite/Star Alliance Gold status) is pleasant, quiet and comfortable with an adequate range of snacks and drinks. Boarding was a bit chaotic as the gate area has people scattered standing around, making it difficult to get to priority boarding easily. Once on board service was efficient and helpful, my Elite status was recognised by getting first requests for all meals for myself and my partner. Dinner was a reasonable fish dish, and breakfast was poached eggs which were heated sufficiently and not too much. Wine, drinks services always very good. Seats are tired and need replacing. 3-3-3 configuration for premium economy isn't good value for money, especially since you lose an inch of seat width as the tray tables fold into the fixed armrests. The seats are quite hard and the leg rest useless for anyone my height or above (I'm 5'10\"). Inflight entertainment system had an adequate selection, but mine was buggy and needed rebooting. Luggage arrived quickly at Christchurch. Overall reasonable experience as the fare premium over economy was only about 22%, but it wouldn't justify full fare.", "air_title": "Air New Zealand ", "Customer_name": "S Wilson"}
