When I checked-in I was told my luggage had exceeded the limit of 15kg. While I understand that such limits are imposed on domestic flights, but for someone who is on a long business trip in India, who has been allowed up to 20kg or 30kg on international flights, how do the authorities expect us to shed off excess weight when flying from one city to the next within India? I was asked to pay for the exceeded amount at a Jet Airways counter. When I went to the counter, the service was extremely slow. The counter staff were more interested in attending to the sale of tickets. Onboard, there is lack of discipline by staff. People were still talking on their phone after the announcement was made not to do so. This is the second time I have flown on Jet Airways. Their lack of interest in the well being of the passengers is worrying. I will never fly Jet Airways again if I can help it.", "air_title": "Jet Airways ", "Customer_name": "A Sabaratnam"}
