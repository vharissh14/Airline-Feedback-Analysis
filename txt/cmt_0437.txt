JFK to Berlin via LHR, then 4 days later Berlin to MAN via LHR, and 6 weeks later Nice to DXB again via LHR. All flights on time, all cabin crew polite, attentive and thoroughly professional. Refreshments, meals and drinks all appropriate for the flights and times of day. It was a pleasure to fly BA after 5 flights with AA. Just one small attitude problem with a ground agent at LHR while boarding for DXB. We were snapped at and told to wait while other passengers (presumably business class) boarded. We were not in the business class 'line', but just happened to be standing near one of the two gates where boarding passes were checked. The ground agent obviously thought that we were economy class passengers trying to board early. Overall a 99% satisfactory rating for these flights. Did not use IFE so unable to give a rating.", "air_title": "British Airways ", "Customer_name": "P Wylie"}
