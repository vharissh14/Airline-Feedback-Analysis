Not sure where to start our most horrible experience up in the air. This wasn't due to any one-off disappointing event that biased the review but an overall awful treatment one is subjected to once they are locked in the cage for 6 hours. Seats: I am not sure if this airline is even complying with the DGCA regulations for how much space needs to be provided to the passengers. Almost everywhere you could hear passengers complaining of congestion. On top of that, seats aren't comfortable. Our international flight was followed by a domestic one (on a different airline) which had much more room than an international flight by Jet airways. Food and Beverages: Food was tasteless. Indian food served on my previous leg (with Qantas) was far better than an Indian airlines serving the same cuisine. My wife didn't even eat it. As for the wine, only suggestion I have for you is not to order it. The staff do not understand wines much but that can be overlooked given this was least of a concern on that flight. Ambience: Temperature setting did add to the discomfort, it was too warm for me to feel comfortable in the pigeon-hole. This wasn't a 1 hr. short hop flight but a long 6 hr. which can even be hard to bear for a whiskey drunk passenger (pun intended). Advice to Qantas would be to reconsider their code share partnership as one doesn't pay a premium (to Qantas) to fly this bird cage. Connection to India will be a tough call given Air India isn't great either, but at least they have new planes.", "air_title": "Jet Airways ", "Customer_name": "Ankit Mishra"}
