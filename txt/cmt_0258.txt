Absolutely disappointed and outraged at the rubbish food served on both flights and obviously what I consider as edible and what BA class as edible we shall truly disagree on - awful food. Coffee rubbish, asked for more water and never got any? The inflight entertainment was also poor and a film was stopped after 30 minutes to reboot the system for other passengers. The male stewards were fine and happy, but one of the female stewardesses was miserable and we felt we were putting her out asking for a drink, which never arrived anyway? Thought BA had got rid of that superior, lucky to fly with us attitude! Will not fly them again if I can help it.", "air_title": "British Airways ", "Customer_name": "T Jones"}
