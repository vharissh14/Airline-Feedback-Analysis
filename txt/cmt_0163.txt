I flew LHR-ABV on Saturday 7th March. This was the Friday 6th flight that had to be rescheduled due to technical issues. Now, if anyone is familiar with this route you will know that service onboard is sometimes not as consistent as say the transatlantic routes. Considering that the flight had been delayed 23 hours, one would have though that cabin crew would have been more attentive. This is not to say they were in any way unprofessional, they were just in a hurry to give you a drink and your meal. There after you barely saw them! Duty Free sped through the cabin faster than Usian Bolt, and landing and immigration cards were handed out just before landing. I was part way through completing mine when I heard the \"Cabin Crew 10 minutes to landing\" announcement! The seat I was sat in had a broken IFE screen hinge and would swing back to the closed position. Fortunately the cabin was not full, which is a first for this route! Sadly the seat I then chose also had an IFE issue too - a minor one but annoying nonetheless. Third time lucky, and hussar! I must add that the choice of films were rather poor too. The food, would have been good, save what was on the main menu. It was a choice of Chickpea Tagine, Chicken, and African Stew. Which region of Africa did that stew pertain to be from, lord knows. Anyway, I opted for the chicken. I must say I was supremely underwhelmed. It was nothing short of a \"school dinner\": flavourless and unappetising.", "air_title": "British Airways ", "Customer_name": "I Gowon"}
