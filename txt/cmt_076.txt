Flight was on time, cabin crew attentive. Downsides were that the seats on the Boeing 777 weren't the most comfortable in the world and the food wasn't fantastic either. It took 1.5 hours for our baggage to come through at Mumbai so even though we arrived an hour early at about 22.30, we didn't leave until midnight. 9W618, CCU-BOM, 21st April. Almost exactly the same although the food was better. 9W118, BOM-LHR, 21st April. Flight was delayed by over an hour because the wind changed and they had to dump 13 tonnes of cargo (thankfully not the luggage). It was very turbulent almost all the way and the cabin crew had to sit down quite a lot but they still managed to get round the cabin 4 times to serve drinks and food. Inflight entertainment was a little sparse, but it kept me entertained for 8 hours so can't complain.", "air_title": "Jet Airways ", "Customer_name": "T Jones"}
