What a massive disappointment - legroom worse than Spicejet, I am over 6 Ft tall, I travelled all the way with my knees resting on the back of the seat in front. Staff not particularly friendly. They don't serve water at the seat - when I asked for water I was told to go and serve myself in the galley. In Frankfurt my flight to Boston was displaying on the screens, but no gate indicated for a long time. I approached a member of staff to ask and was told \"I am not the Information counter\". What kind of customer service does Lufthansa think it is providing? The return flight to India was not much different. I have vowed to never to fly this airline.", "air_title": "Lufthansa ", "Customer_name": "Barua Anondo"}
