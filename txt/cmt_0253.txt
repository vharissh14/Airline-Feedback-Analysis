Flight departed on time, we were received well by staff at check-in and had no problems leaving MEX. Aircraft a 747, which was old yet fairly clean. Entertainment system was a little dated but once they got it working provided light relief. Service was very good, staff were attentive, whilst not overwhelming which is important on a night flight: we were not disturbed but knew refreshments could be brought when requested. Terminal 5 was easy to navigate and flight to TLS left almost on time. Uneventful second flight but nevertheless a good experience. Overall good service and communicative staff, dated aircraft and equipment. Would definitely recommend, service far better than other transatlantic airlines I have experienced.", "air_title": "British Airways ", "Customer_name": "R Shoebridge"}
