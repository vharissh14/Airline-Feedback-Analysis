Outbound on 747-800. Beautiful plane and has a high tech feel. New Business Class is nice but somewhat cramped - the seats are very narrow and there is really no storage space. The angled seats puts your feet uncomfortably close to your neighbors. Service on board was very professional and attentive. The meal out of Newark was surprisingly good with an excellent fillet mignon but ground service was lacking - boarding was delayed by almost an hour after it was announced for unclear reasons and the lounge was crowded with terrible internet. Connecting flight on A321 - just economy seats for business class price. Nice service but terrible product. Return was supposed to be on United from Frankfurt but flight delayed for 7 hrs due to mechanical so switched to LH400. Again impeccable service but meal, as is standard for Lufthansa out of Frankfurt, barely edible - tough lamb with weird vegetables. Desert so small one needs a microscope to see it. The breads served were the best part of the meal. The biggest problem is Lufthansa's angled business class seat. The most uncomfortable business class seat in the air. The IFE system had very limited choices. We circled JFK due to a bad snow storm and then waited for gate forever - total delay of 2.5 hrs. but the crew kept everyone informed and were very nice. Bottom line - highly professional service with sub par cabins.", "air_title": "Lufthansa ", "Customer_name": "O Benyehuda"}
