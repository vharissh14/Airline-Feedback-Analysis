Overall, good. Which amazed us, as two years ago we flew London to Delhi and back, and swore never to use Jet again, as the flight home was the worst we've ever had anywhere in the world. This time, the flight from London to Delhi was very good, nice plane, good crew, average food. Internal flights were also good. The flight back - well, it was an older plane, a bit tatty inside, the floors hadn't been cleaned properly between flights, the food was terrible, the seats sagged, but it landed ahead of schedule and the cabin crew were great. So 4 flights out of 5 were very good, and if they put on a new plane and better food on the last leg, they'd have scored a very good overall.", "air_title": "Jet Airways ", "Customer_name": "Stephen Nicholas"}
