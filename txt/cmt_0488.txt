Yes, the pilot got us where the ticket said we were going I'll them credit, but felt crammed like sardines the entire time. Cant comment on the food as we had seat only plus bag, though if you want to go for 8 hours without food or movies, good luck getting sleep in these seats. Also should you choose no food or movies you get treated a bit like a second class citizen by some of the staff members. Ground staff, lounge staff were good.", "air_title": "Air New Zealand ", "Customer_name": "K Hulse"}
