I travelled with my parents. The check-in process was uneventful, and the ground staff was very amiable. Boarding was quite chaotic. Though it was announced that boarding would be sequential, this was completely ignored. There were multiple queues converging into one and the ground staff had to literally plead to people to form a single queue. The greeting by the crew was pleasant and it was not long before all were seated and the plane started taxiing. 20 minutes into the journey and the cabin crew wheeled in the food trolleys. Being a late noon flight, we were served a warm roll (choice of paneer or chicken), a chocolate, a tamarind sweet, and a small bottle of water. I opted for the chicken roll, which was tasty but quite dry. The service was very irregular and uneven. My aisle co-passenger received his food tray 5 minutes before mine. Within 10 minutes, the crew returned to collect the trays. I was still eating my chicken roll, and so the cabin crew member asked me to keep the chocolate and water and return the tray to him. Talk about a mad rush! Then they started serving tea and coffee, again very randomly. My row was conveniently missed out. When I later asked for tea, they politely refused saying that it was time for landing. In all, the cabin crew seemed quite inexperienced. Here's hoping for a better in-flight experience the next time I fly with Jet.", "air_title": "Jet Airways ", "Customer_name": "Gonsalves Gavin"}
