With the exception of one seemingly bored and unfriendly flight attendant both crews were highly professional, obviously well trained, attentive and friendly. Both flights on time, the cabins spotless. Good Service as usual, especially regarding drinks. The only problem are the snacks they offered. On the first sector a plastic cup of fresh fruit salad and yoghurt, tasty but not at all filling. Much worse on the flight back: a slice of disgusting lukewarm pizza of low quality in a bland cardboard box without logo, a really bad presentation. Such a pity that this reliable airline, one of the very best in my opinion, is failing again and again with the snacks and food which is offered. Very good ticket rate, booked early in advance.", "air_title": "Lufthansa ", "Customer_name": "F Juergens"}
