Every flight is late, the catering gets worse and worse and the attitude of the crew has also deteriorated. I have taken 5 flights in 2 months, and every single sector has been late. Even the crew in first class have no idea what \"service\" means - I have to ask for things 2 or 3 times, I am not offered anything unless I ask, the food is inedible (they tried to serve me a poached egg which I could have played squash with), they ran out of bottled water in a flight out of LHR, I cannot find any flights when I can use my free companion voucher, or use my miles to upgrade. they won't even allow my PA to deal my flights for me. it just seems the rules and attitude of their management has become so far removed from their promise To Fly to Serve.", "air_title": "British Airways ", "Customer_name": "L Hunt"}
