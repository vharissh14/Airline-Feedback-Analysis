I was in Business Class both ways. The service and attention to detail is exemplary. Even in the middle of the night, pushing the call button got immediate attention. The food both ways was exceptional and it was always nice to be asked if I would like some more, or is their anything else I can get you. In these days of cost cutting in service and staff on tight contracts, Air NZ staff really do go that extra mile and really do look like they enjoy their jobs. The flights arrived early both ends which is always welcomed, the pilots very rarely get the recognition they deserve in these surveys.", "air_title": "Air New Zealand ", "Customer_name": "R Connett"}
