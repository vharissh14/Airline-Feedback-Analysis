Whenever we fly between Germany and the US we fly Lufthansa. The seat comfort in Economy class seats is a pain. Business or First Class I can recommend without hesitation. The service is always excellent and I always enjoyed that! We had the seats at the emergency exit which we take if we have to fly Economy, as Senator without extra charge, as a standard passenger with extra charge. The space you have in this seat is limited, the only plus is the leg room but people who try to go to the bathroom step into it, hit your legs etc. Wondering why there is no Economy Plus as an option.", "air_title": "Lufthansa ", "Customer_name": "Egbert Schroeer"}
