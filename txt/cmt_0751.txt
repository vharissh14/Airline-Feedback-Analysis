New refurbished Business cabin on the A380 is very comfortable, and a lovely decent sized pillow on which to sleep. Lie flat seat/bed is good, but could be a bit narrow at shoulder level. However, I managed 5-6 hrs sleep, which is unusual for me on a lon flight. Food delicious, especially on my outbound FRA-JNB sector, Roast Goose which was perfect! Crew on all sectors were friendly and professional, and the transit through FRA was a breeze. I would advise people to choose seats at rear of the 380 upper deck, pref. row 26/27 as LH serve their food from the rear, moving forward, so you'll always have a full menu choice if seated here. A lovely travelling experience with an airline that maintains its pedigree.", "air_title": "Lufthansa ", "Customer_name": "Andrew Noble"}
