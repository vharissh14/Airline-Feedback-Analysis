What a miserable experience this was. This return ticket was \u00a3950 for a total of about 140 mins flying time. I checked in online and there was considerable delays on this as there was, following a phone call back to the UK, an equipment change, from an A319 to an A320. Anyway I checked in online eventually and made my way through security. I asked an information post - as to where the Club / Business class lounge was and I was told it was land side and between \"this terminal and the next terminal\". I could not believe it. Surely a simple prompt online when checking in - could have told me this. Flight left on time, a reasonable light lunch and three Gin and Tonics later we got stacked over the East End for 25 minutes but landed \"ahead of schedule\". A miserable experience from the so called \"world's favorite airline\".", "air_title": "British Airways ", "Customer_name": "Clive V Drake"}
