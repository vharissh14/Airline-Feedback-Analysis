Journey from Hyderabad - Delhi was fine without any issues. At Delhi airport we were informed that the 10.40 am flight would be delayed and would depart at 12.00 pm. At around 11.45 am the cancellation of the flight is announced, apparently due to dense fog at Patna airport. At this point there was no Jet Konnect representative at the gate. We were directed to another gate where one representative, was dealing with requests from passengers of two cancelled flights. From there we were taken to the baggage collection area and were asked if we would be interested in taking a refund or travel to Ranchi instead. We chose to travel to Ranchi. They took my boarding pass from Delhi - Patna and said that they would be giving me a Delhi - Ranchi pass. When my name was announced I see that I was handed my old Hyderabad - Delhi pass. On reaching Ranchi (4 hours after our scheduled arrival in Patna) we asked if we would get any monetary assistance for further travel to our original intended destination. These requests were shot down immediately. We had a terrible experience and won't be flying with Jet Airways again.", "air_title": "Jet Airways ", "Customer_name": "Rahul Choubey"}
