However, I was very angry that the IFE did not work in my seat. Despite three attempts to reset it. Kaput! Not exactly satisfying when you pay premium $$ for a seat on a long-haul flight. The onboard wifi was also broken. I do have to say though that the purser came to apologize to me and she did a great job in explaining the situation re all the technical difficulties. Was appreciated. The food presentation and choices were excellent despite the flight attendants' initial insistence on speaking German to me even when I repeatedly asked them a question in English.
