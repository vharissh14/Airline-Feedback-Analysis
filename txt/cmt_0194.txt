We travelled in economy, the seats were cramped and hard. It was freezing cold, so cold in fact passengers wore coats with a blankets on them as well. The food was awful, no choice whatsoever. I asked for a coffee because I was so cold but had to wait an hour and then had to ask again before I received it. The flight attendants on both flights did not look smart, appeared to want to perform there duties as quickly as possible without any care for the passengers wishes, so that they could stand and chat at back of flight and catch up with each other. We have had better flights on easyjet.", "air_title": "British Airways ", "Customer_name": "D Sampayo"}
