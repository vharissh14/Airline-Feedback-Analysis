Hong Kong to London Sector on 17/9/14. Inedible food, lukewarm drinks, cabin staff unsmiling and standard of personal grooming very low, toilets were horrible- no loo paper or hand towels half way through 13 hour flight. It was a relief to get onto Cathay Pacific flight for next stage of my journey. How can two airlines be so different? British Airways is a disgrace.", "air_title": "British Airways ", "Customer_name": "C Polson"}
