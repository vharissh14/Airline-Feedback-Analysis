Everything worked as expected. The flight was on time both for departure and landing. Check-in, security, boarding as well as disembarkation and baggage retrieval worked without a hitch. On-board service was competent and caring. No complaints at all, for Economy Class you can't do much better than that.", "air_title": "Lufthansa ", "Customer_name": "Christian Sage"}
