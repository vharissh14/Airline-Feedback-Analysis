I flew YVR-LHR as the final sector of a round- the-world trip, and I have to say I will not be in a hurry to repeat the experience. The 747-436 looked tired and ready for a refit or the breakers yard. The seat was the most uncomfortable economy seat I have ever sat in, despite the headrest 'wings' which are a nice feature. The lower part of the seat backs are fibre, not hard plastic, enabling the passenger behind to put their knees into the small of your back. this happened frequently throughout our bumpy flight. The cabin service was lacklustre and the breakfast unappetizing. Its a shame that our national carrier has such a mediocre product, compared with Emirates or Air NZ. If I was a teacher, I would mark BA as 'can do better'.", "air_title": "British Airways ", "Customer_name": "G Arnold"}
