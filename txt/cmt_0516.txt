The infant fare also doesn't include checked luggage which meant we had to spend another $155 each leg for 23kgs of luggage. Compare this to Qantas where both the 'extras' of the bassinet seat and 23kgs luggage were included as part of the fare. Overall we had to spend $255 extra on each leg for an infant to travel, on top of a relatively high base fare. When I discussed this with AirNZ customer service they indicated the cabin luggage limit of 7kgs should be perfectly fine for travelling long haul with an infant, obviously never travelled with a child. Very disappointed with Air NZ's approach to infant travel as well as the response of the customer service representative.", "air_title": "Air New Zealand ", "Customer_name": "V Hunter"}
