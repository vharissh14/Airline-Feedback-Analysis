My flight from Mumbai was scheduled to take off at 1.40am IST and land in London at 6.45am GMT. I had planned another flight from London to Stuttgart at 8.45am GMT (2 hours later) keeping in mind check out, immigration and check in time. The flight from Mumbai took off 4 hours later at 5.40 in the morning. Now, I have been on flights that have been delayed and it is no new experience for me. What was new for me though was the way in which the whole issue was dealt with. The first officer announced 10 minutes before scheduled departure that the flight was being delayed 15 minutes due to maintenance checks. Almost 30 minutes later the Captain came on and said that there were delays and due to a technical check we would be delayed by a further 30 minutes. Almost an hour later, we were told that there are even further delays and through out the entire time span, the passengers were left absolutely clueless. Never ever before have I been on a flight where the ETA on the flight information screen was only shared with passengers on the Inflight Entertainment 30 minutes before landing. This is the first and the last time that I will fly Jet Airways.", "air_title": "Jet Airways ", "Customer_name": "Thiyagarajan Niranjan"}
