The flight was overbooked, the seats were horribly uncomfortable, and the food was terrible. Perhaps Air NZ have fitted another row into economy, it is intolerably cramped - my knees touched the seat in front of me and I couldn't comfortably put my arms by my sides for 13 hours! I'm a small woman! The seat in front of me was so close that I couldn't watch a movie! Didn't matter because after 6 hours, the entertainment center failed in our row!", "air_title": "Air New Zealand ", "Customer_name": "Johanna Om"}
