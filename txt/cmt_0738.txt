One of the stewards didn't want to talk, he just indicated questions by nodding. The flight was not completely full, but the crew seemed to be strained - maybe due to problems with the entertainment system - so that they only seemed to care for the guest who couldn't use the entertainment. I am used to a much better service provided by Lufthansa - my last flight to NY in September this year for example was one of the best flights I ever experienced - the crew was very attentive, the purser introduced herself to me and offered me another seat. They even brought me food from the business class. I'm not expecting this for every flight, but I expect the crew to be friendly and attentive.", "air_title": "Lufthansa ", "Customer_name": "Rebecca Ehrenwirth"}
