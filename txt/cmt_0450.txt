Supplied headphones did not work. Warm, attentive stewards. Low salt meals very tasty. Always served first, though would have liked standard English breakfast - not low salt. Seat though standard economy was soft. BA9, LHR-Bangkok, 18 Sept, Older 777. Stewardesses interested and human in their approach. VDU not that brilliant. Food also quite satisfying. Bags on both occasions arrived promptly. Well done BA.", "air_title": "British Airways ", "Customer_name": "Parry-Williams Garth"}
