The foot rest was very narrow, the IFE screen was big but the movie and TV selection was not too big. Food was good and the portions where generous, I enjoyed the crepe for breakfast, no amenity kit was offered. Flight attendants were professional, when needed they were present but otherwise they did not bother you when watching a TV program or a movie as does happen on other airlines. The flight from Frankfurt to Paris was on time comfortable and all our bags came through.", "air_title": "Lufthansa ", "Customer_name": "A Althani"}
