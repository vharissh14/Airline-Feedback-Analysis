Spent an age going through all the information and was poised to spend a small fortune on allocated seats and then found I started getting spurious (but in no way informative) error messages referring me to a (German) telephone number. I decided after several attempts to use the Lufthansa webchat and a nice but not very helpful woman took me all the way through the very laborious process, only to inform me after all that their website is not compatible with Google Chrome. So my Sister tried it for me on her PC and it failed yet again. Half the population uses Google Chrome! Lufthansa, you really need yo try harder than this. Appalling start to our first ever Lufthansa experience. I am rating the airline on the various categories listed here as it won't let me submit a review without doing so.", "air_title": "Lufthansa ", "Customer_name": "J Tydeman"}
