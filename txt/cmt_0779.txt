Airbus A330-300 (333) V1 (re-vamped interior with the new LH biz class seats), seated in eco, emergency row 30, window seat pair. Status customer with LH (senator), travelling with partner. Ground service (baggage drop-off, lounge etc.) seamless as always. Sky service attentive, quick, quiet, very professional, little kids of other passengers, and elderly passengers, all taken care of with help. Sky catering as good as you can expect in eco, little treats added to the overall good level. New version of LH safety script at taxiing is much improved, easy-to-understand, delivered at the right, slow pace w/o becoming dragging and boring. Also no bothering bold music during take-off/landing times, as with some other *A carriers. Overall, LH manifests that they are of course not the cheapest, but they quietly excel in numerous details by those few percent compared to others. You just feel that little bit less worn after an LH eco long-haul, as you might do after one with other carriers.", "air_title": "Lufthansa ", "Customer_name": "Matthias Ullrich"}
