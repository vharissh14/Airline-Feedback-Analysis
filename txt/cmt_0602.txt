Staff very friendly and professional. Catering - not really a positive surprise, perhaps in case of the Shanghai route hard oriented to Chinese food and not New Zealand. However, if you're booked on the 777 it's ok, if the flight is operated on the 767-300 - forget it ! The flight back from Auckland to Shanghai (12 hours) was really poor on the very narrow recliner seats of the old 767\u00b4s.", "air_title": "Air New Zealand ", "Customer_name": "Sch\u00f6gler Chris"}
