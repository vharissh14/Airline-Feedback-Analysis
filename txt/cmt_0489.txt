The cabin was new and very comfortable. The IFE was great with a very responsive touch screen that was more like a tablet than the usual unresponsive screens. The seat was very good with plenty of space - I am a large man and usually my knees touch the back of the seat but not on this plane. I didn't try the food as I was not feeling that well but the crew have a relaxed but competent manner.", "air_title": "Air New Zealand ", "Customer_name": "A O'Flynn"}
