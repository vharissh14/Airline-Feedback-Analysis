The aircraft that I fly on from London to Mexico city are 747-400, these aircraft have obviously travelled many hundreds of thousands of air miles, the seats are mostly very worn and hard, a 12 to 13 hour flight leaves one with a very numb part of the anatomy, toilets seats are more often than not insecure or broken. Food offered is now without a menu, you get what you are given or go without from two choices, the famous BA breakfast is now no more, just a sandwich or a frozen roll. The inflight entertainment is often non functional and regular resetting of the system is quite normal, sound quality is always very bad. My comments are not directed at just one flight or one aircraft only, I have seen this deterioration over quite a few years, whilst I fully appreciate economy and money saving is today's norm, major airlines to my mind should think customer satisfaction at all levels, not just the First class and Business class customers. I have seen other airlines achieve and maintain very high standards in today's economic world of airline travel, but sadly BA seem to be trailing to an embarrassing extent.", "air_title": "British Airways ", "Customer_name": "Dick John Parfett"}
