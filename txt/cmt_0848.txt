Fantastic flight with bonus points from miles and more in first for the entire family to Vancouver. Very friendly service both on the ground (the lounge in Munich was superb) and during the flight. The crew were very helpful and friendly. Everything was perfect except for the luggage delivery in Vancouver which despite our priority tags came last.", "air_title": "Lufthansa ", "Customer_name": "Schulz Stefan"}
