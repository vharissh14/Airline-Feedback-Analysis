I'm sitting in their so called \"club world\" which is the equivalent to Americans business class and this plane is awful! There is no room to put anything at all. Everything, and I mean everything goes in storage. You are literally looking straight at the person next to you. Attendants are rude. Don't waste your money. While its nice to go non-stop between Austin and London this will be the last time I ever take this flight.", "air_title": "British Airways ", "Customer_name": "J Smith"}
