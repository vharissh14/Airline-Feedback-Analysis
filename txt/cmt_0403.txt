Instead of three rows of seats A and B, we were now slung across a single row, with 4 middle seats and an aisle/window seat, despite having requested and paid for the seat reservations 11 months ago. To make matters worse, Prem Economy passengers had been bumped up to Club World and were enjoying A/B seats - total joke. Food was OK, crew were friendly enough, but I will never travel BA again due to the absolute neglect or consideration for their premium customers. Goodbye BA Executive Club and good riddance BA.
