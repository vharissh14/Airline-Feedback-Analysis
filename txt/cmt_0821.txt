Was my first time and was very curious about it. The upper deck business class is very quiet and has a private feel to it. I also like that you have a private storage compartment right below the window, like on the upper deck of an A380. Lufthansa has made some innovative design choices. For example, in the bathrooms, the toilet seat and cover both have a separate handle, so that it's easy to lift either up. Such a simple invention, yet I've never seen it on other airlines. The new biz class seat is a huge improvement over the old angled-flat seat, which is still used on all their other planes. It's a friendly configuration, for if you're traveling with a friend, the seats are slightly angled towards each other, making it easy to converse. In sleep mode, the seat is unfortunately not too comfortable, especially since the footrest where your feet go is very narrow. The food and service was ok. They had a good selection of wines and the menu had a regional focus, focusing on cuisine from the area you're flying from. Love the idea, however, taste wise it was not outstanding. Overall though, a huge improvement from their old business class. I hope they upgrade the rest of their long-haul fleet with these seats.", "air_title": "Lufthansa ", "Customer_name": "Tercon Bojan"}
