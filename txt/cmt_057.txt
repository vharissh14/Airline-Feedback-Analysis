The plane was on time, but the flight attendants were rude. They never smiled or wanted to exchange pleasantries. The seats were cramped and tight. I was traveling with my husband, and our journey to New Delhi was completed without much hassle. On our way back to Toronto, we were seated in two different seats and was told at the counter that the flights were full and they wouldn't change our seats. On boarding the same rude flight attendants greeted us. The only time we saw them smiling was when we were leaving the plane. On boarding we noticed that it was not only us who were seated separately, almost all the couples had the same issue, fortunately we were able to exchange seats. This was the same problem on the flight from Brussels to Toronto. The food we received was of substandard quality when compared to other airlines. The fruit tray they served for breakfast had mould on the fruit. The inflight entertainment system had very few movies, we listened to our iPod instead. Ground staff at New Delhi Airport were rude and not helpful. They need considerable improvements in organizing their seats and other basic things, like training flight attendants to international standards.", "air_title": "Jet Airways ", "Customer_name": "Alex Chaligne"}
