The flight into Raro was fine except for the simply fair quality of food. The seating in economy was comfortable for a 9 hour overnight international flight. My primary complaint is about the terribly long lines for check-in at Raro for the Saturday night departure to LAX. The check-in counter is outside in a warm and humid climate and there are only 3 or 4 people working to serve scores of passengers and handle their baggage. We stood in line for over 1.5 hours even though we arrived 2 hours ahead of departure. There's obviously poor management for a process that occurs once per week and seemingly could easily be remedied by having a couple of more persons on staff for this check-in, installation of some kiosks, a faster computer system and some fans outside of the counter area. If you're infirm, elderly or don't want your vacation capped off by a very unpleasant experience on your departure, consider some other destination (or perhaps Virgin Australia).", "air_title": "Air New Zealand ", "Customer_name": "J Johnson"}
