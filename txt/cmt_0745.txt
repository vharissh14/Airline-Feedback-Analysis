A321 both ways. LH2479 and LH2470. Outbound was very full. So much so I had to put my weekend hand luggage under the seat in front. Crew where friendly and professional. Inbound less busy. Leg room was sufficient for a short flight and the snack and drink was fresh. On time departure inbound but we were bussed from the jet to the terminal at LHR.", "air_title": "Lufthansa ", "Customer_name": "Denzil Bourne"}
