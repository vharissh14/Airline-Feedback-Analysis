Technical problems with plane resulted in an hour delay. Repairs were attempted while on runway and after again trying to depart, plane was moved to another part of runway, close to airport building. We were parked there for 6 hours. During that time absolute mayhem took place. For the first few hours there were no communication and it became clear this airline has no contingency plan and should not be flying. As business class passengers we received no support and passengers were physically prevented from leaving the plane, though we were about 25 metres away from an airbridge. Half the plane without connections were put on another plane to Singapore and we were kept detained on the plane for another few hours. Eventually a Customer Service Manager appeared. We were then told it would take 3 days before we could fly due to tickets not being available. After insisting on tickets it took another hour before we were offered economy class tickets, which were rejected. After another hour we were offered premium class tickets to Bangkok, and then Melbourne. The flight was 2 am and we were offered a hotel room, which I had to share with a stranger. I was very relieved to get on Thai Airlines from Bangkok. As for Jet Airways, I will never fly with them again!", "air_title": "Jet Airways ", "Customer_name": "C Van Heerden"}
