When I called Lufthansa to book my outbound flight to Munich, Germany, I inquired that 25 minutes to arrive at the gate to my connecting flight out of O'Hare Airport was impossible but she assured me I should not have any issues. Well, I did, my flight was late and I had to run though a crowded airport to get a shuttle bus to the connecting flight gate (United Airlines, flight UA 6115 and UA952 on July 4 2014). My flight arrived at 5.25 and my connecting flight starting boarding at 5.20. My inbound (return flight home) was the worst Lufthansa flight I had been on. The plane was a smaller plane, only 1 lavatory to serve the economy area on the plane and the food was horrible. I am considering never flying Lufthansa again.", "air_title": "Lufthansa ", "Customer_name": "T Anderson"}
