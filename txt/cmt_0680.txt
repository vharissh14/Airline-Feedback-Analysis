We booked Lufthansa for our flight from Munich to Miami, a 11.5h flight. We wanted to avoid an awkward flight with no space, therefore we chose LH and paid more compared to other airlines. They say: there is no better way to fly. Honestly, this was the poorest flight over the Atlantic. Absolutely no space to sit, a domestic flight usually offers more space. The touchscreens almost were not controllable. You could touch them, but they did not react, so we could not really enjoy the inflight entertainment. The stewardess tried to help, she was nice, rebooted the system several times, but it did not really work as it was to supposed to. Will never do it again.", "air_title": "Lufthansa ", "Customer_name": "Decker Alexander"}
