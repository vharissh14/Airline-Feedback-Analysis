Our trip started with a 2 hour delay, which was poorly communicated. They claimed it was due to a \"seat\" which needed to be repaired. This delay caused us a lot of trouble and extra cost, as we missed our connection that night as well as first nights accommodation on an island resort - not cheap. The flight was uncomfortable at 5+ hours on an old 767 which was unclean. The guide in the seat pocket was full of chewing gum. Furthermore the volume on the safety video was so loud that passengers had to cover their ears. The video in general was also excessively long, overly animated and ridiculous. Our second flight with ANZ, we were already completely put off by this video and found it annoying. The crew served water from an unclean looking plastic pitcher. Never seen this on an airline before, not even on a low cost carrier. Furthermore, the audacity that ANZ charges a hefty membership \"fee\" to join their frequent flyer programme - first time hearing about this.", "air_title": "Air New Zealand ", "Customer_name": "C Fonseca"}
