Overall a good flight. Very full, so no free seat at all in the cabin. Staff very friendly. Cabin very modern. I had requested an Asian vegetarian menu, however it turned out as a \"normal\" tasteless vegetarian rice and vegetable. Staff tried and provided some veggie pasta, which was ok. Overall satisfied with the flight.", "air_title": "Lufthansa ", "Customer_name": "Dinixo Geht"}
