To begin with, when I reached Mumbai airport with our online check in printouts 4 hours before scheduled departure I was pleasantly surprised to see the BA staff ready to check in the baggage. We were thru checked in up to Chicago with a 5 hour halt at LHR. London Heathrow Terminal 5 is chaotic to say the least, the security taking forever (in our case 45 min) to clear the hand baggage gave us some 3 hours before we boarded our Chicago flight which was comfortable. Our next connection from Chicago to SFO on AA was a bit messy as the cabin space was full and last minute check-in of hand baggage was enforced. Then for our SFO-LHR-DEL flight, the SFO-LHR got delayed but again check-in was pleasant and though the connection time between two flights was 80 minutes, because of the delay we had a margin of only 35 minutes. When we requested the flight purser to let us disembark before anyone else, he said \"why did you take this connection, even if you make it somehow, your baggage wont\" - so much for assistance! Even after disembarking last of all, we were met by the BA representative at the gate who took us thru the fast track channel and we made it to the flight in a record 20 minutes. All went well except for one tiny hitch, one piece of baggage never made it to our next flight.", "air_title": "British Airways ", "Customer_name": "Sharma Anita"}
