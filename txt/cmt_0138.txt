The club world product feels really old now. The seats are narrow and not up to the standards of a world class airline. It was innovative when it came out, but now feels narrow, dated and not a match even to Air India which has modern flat seats on the Dreamliner. The food was OK, but nothing special. The service was also ok but lacked touches like smiles, hot towels. Amenity kits very cheap. The young Indian crew members on the Delhi route, noticeably better than the older London based British crew. The plane was an old and slightly grubby 747. Basically everything was mediocre if adequate. The overall impression was a product past it's prime from the 1990s. Old planes, old crew, old seats, old IFE, BA are losing ground not just to Emirates but also other European carriers like LH or AF. It feels like the 1970s and 1980s before BA transformed itself.", "air_title": "British Airways ", "Customer_name": "K Rahman"}
