Very friendly staff, always smiling, no IFE as they are all very short flights. Seats are hard and thin, but still comfortable. Not all flights had meals but the food and drinks were alright. But now Lufthansa is famous to me for losing my luggage as I lost them twice with only 4 flights, should have better luggage services.", "air_title": "Lufthansa ", "Customer_name": "Yiyi Chen"}
