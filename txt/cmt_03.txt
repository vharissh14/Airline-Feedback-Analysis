Without a change of culture, training and people they never will be. Flew Singapore Delhi and return in economy. Staff can be good if they feel like it but after take off from Changi they lost all interest. Delhi to Singapore was forgettable. Food is poor, service is basic, seat comfort poor, entertainment very average. Overall, avoid unless necessary.", "air_title": "Jet Airways ", "Customer_name": "Ralph Tony"}
