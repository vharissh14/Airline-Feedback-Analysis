Seat was very good and comfortable with many adjustments. Great dining options, good quality of snacks available throughout the flight. Crew very nice. One thing I did not like was the layout, making it difficult for people in the middle to have aisle access when seat were turned into beds. And staring directly into people's faces when the curtain between seats is down can be awkward. Crew didn't care too much about safety issues like seat reclining and window blinds for takeoff and landing. Entertainment was a bit disappointing, screens were old and blurry, not a big selection.", "air_title": "British Airways ", "Customer_name": "J Hertz"}
