Although we had a good experience five years ago on the same leg, their service has substantially deteriorated over time. Rude, unresponsive flight attendants who could not care less about passengers, poor to indecent meal quality, chaotic seat allocation (we were a family of 4 and we were scattered all across the A330, online check in the day before departure did not let us reserve seats, saying \"no seating available\"). Unhelpful staff at Brussels airport. To sum it up, extremely disappointed. Would not fly Jet Airways again and would certainly not recommend.", "air_title": "Jet Airways ", "Customer_name": "Didier Nemery"}
