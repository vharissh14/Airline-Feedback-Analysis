Both flights were excellent with good, efficient service and responsive in flight entertainment. The wifi (paid service) was excellent and really helped to pass the time during the long 11-12hr flights. One passenger had an eating disorder and for some reason there had a misunderstanding and Lufthansa didn't have a meal for them. I was very impressed how the chief purser went out of her way for the passenger offering him food from business class and at one stage even her own food! The outbound flight was delayed due to a technical malfunction just as we were taxiing to the runway. However was impressed with how Lufthansa handled this. The pilot kept us informed several times and we were only delayed by an additional hour. Overall, I highly recommend Lufthansa!", "air_title": "Lufthansa ", "Customer_name": "Glenn Standish"}
