Outbound flight YYZ-LHR was delayed by an hour. Good thing they sent a text message well ahead of time. Boarding was quick and efficient, in flight entertainment (IFE) was superb with plenty of very good choices, latest releases. Probably the best I've seen in Economy class. Service was ok, normal. B777 was great - I'm 6ft 4in, so I asked for bulkhead seats. I ordered a special meal and it was ready for all four sections of my journey. LHR-DXB portion all good (B747). On the way back, DXB-LHR was great (B777) - I took the 3.20pm outbound flight right after my business was completed (as opposed to taking those 1-2am flights that are offered by other air carriers). LHR-YYZ flew on the new Dreamliner 787. I was not too impressed with the seat configuration and space. To me the 777 was more comfortable. All in all I was pleased with BA's service and comfort.", "air_title": "British Airways ", "Customer_name": "Milan Zelcevic"}
