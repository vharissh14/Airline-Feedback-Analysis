You really wonder sometimes with BA. I paid \u00a3940 return and what a joke. (Last year I flew Stuttgart and Berlin in Club for about\u00a3\u00a3600 and was very happy). Firstly the flight ran from T1 at LHR. T5 Club lounge is rather good. On first sight the T1 lounge looked OK. I arrived at 15.03 and was told hot food was not available after 3pm. With a bit of grovelling I managed to get a plate of Singapore Chicken curry from the waitress. The whole food area consisted of a few miserable sandwich's, peanuts and a miserable looking soup. Drinks ok. Flight was an A319 which left about 40 minutes late. Couldn't be bothered to eat the Prawn salad - which actually looked ok. FA's were fine. In summary a real big BA con. Flight was one hour and at \u00a3450+ per hour it costs more than a 7 hour flight in First to JFK. A miserable experience.", "air_title": "British Airways ", "Customer_name": "Clive Drake"}
