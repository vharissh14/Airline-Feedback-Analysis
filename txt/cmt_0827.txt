Don't worry, the chicken is fine. What do you want more for your money? I did continue on Air Canada, with expensive poor food in domestic, headset you pay for but which do not work, is that really necessary to save cost? I would rather fly on Lufthansa.", "air_title": "Lufthansa ", "Customer_name": "A Fischer"}
