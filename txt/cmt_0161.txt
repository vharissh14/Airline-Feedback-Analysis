Departed on time a breakfast served by a pretty nice crew, not that much room really for business class appears to be getting less. Return check in quick although security at Sofia very slow and the lounge is not worth using!! flight delayed around an hour due to weather but once away a decent meal served by yet another nice crew, landed around 30 min late on a remote stand but bags on the belt by the time I reached it.", "air_title": "British Airways ", "Customer_name": "C Cutts"}
