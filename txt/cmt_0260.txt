Old, tired plane (777) with a 3-4-3 set up for a 13 hour flight (compared to a far more comfortable 2-4-2 on Iberia), IFE screens smaller than any other airline with very limited options, uncomfortable seats with minimal leg room. FA's adequate as was the meal. I don't understand why BA is 4-star rated and Iberia and LAN are 3-stars or how they can charge much more than any other European airline? They don't even want to try and being British I am really disappointed with the state of our flagship carrier. How are they going to compete with Emirates, Qatar etc?", "air_title": "British Airways ", "Customer_name": "S Maitra"}
