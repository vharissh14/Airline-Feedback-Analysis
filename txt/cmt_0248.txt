Excellent trip. We were celebrating my wife's birthday on the way out and the staff were outstanding. Professional, attentive but also able to have a laugh with customers. The food was excellent and the wine selection very good as well. Lounge at Heathrow was also very good (T5 is a pleasure to use). Return (overnight) flight also very good - efficient staff and seats comfortable enough to get some sleep.", "air_title": "British Airways ", "Customer_name": "Simon Prestcote"}
