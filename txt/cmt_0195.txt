The outbound flight was ok. Nothing special as always. The seats are the new fitted seats for European flight. The meal was abysmal compared to AF. The return flight was really annoying. One of the FA was rude. He looked bored and tired as it was the last flight of the day. He showed no interest in collecting the used cups. I know it was a short flight but it was just unacceptable. It's just a shame to see once a great airline is declining like that.", "air_title": "British Airways ", "Customer_name": "Carlos Blanco"}
