I learnt that with the cheaper tickets, a seat reservation is no longer possible. So even if you check in online (24 hours prior to the flight), only middle seats are available - absolutely impossible for people like me! I had luck that one person didn't check in so one of the seats with additional leg space was available. The crew supported me in this (the woman at the check-in told me that the seat maybe would be available and I should ask at the gate, as I've arrived at the gate, they already were informed). So this time, leg space was no issue but if you don't like close contact to your neighbors, you will not stay in the seat for a long time! You can't sit erect, you have to buckle. I've spend more than 50% of the time walking around and chatting with the very friendly crew. For me (not paying an extra charge), this seat was OK. But for my neighbor, who paid extra, it was annoying - he like me was more walking around than sitting in the insufficient seat!", "air_title": "Lufthansa ", "Customer_name": "K Fortwaengler"}
