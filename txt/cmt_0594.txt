The seating on this flight was comfortable enough, but the connection from an international to a domestic flight at Auckland airport really needs to be improved (though this is obviously not the fault of Air New Zealand). The flight itself however was delayed and no calls were made about the delay until 40 minutes after the scheduled departure time. Better communication is needed.", "air_title": "Air New Zealand ", "Customer_name": "A Chauhan"}
