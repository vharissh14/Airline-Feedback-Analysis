As a British Citizen, you desperately want to like BA, but they do make it very difficult to do so. The recent documentary \"A Very British Airline\" whetted our appetite that perhaps a commitment to service may have returned to BA, particularly in the long-haul premium cabins. Sadly, on all the legs, the cabin service was totally indifferent without any effort to do more than the bare minimum. Attendants chewing gum, no smiles, everything was all too much effort. The only time the crew showed any animation was when talking to each other. Adequate is about the best description but it could have been so much better without any cost except a bit of effort.", "air_title": "British Airways ", "Customer_name": "P Oliver"}
