Constant changes to schedule meant that I had less than an hour to transfer in Delhi instead of three, which is not enough to get through the Indian airport rubber stamping fiesta. Was not informed of this via email or phone, only found out when I checked my booking 3 weeks before departure. Had to change the date since the Pune-Delhi flight I was going to take was cancelled and they refused to book me on another airline for my original date. Flight crew are unfriendly, food is inedible (pink rice with brown sauce from the look of it). The seat in front of you reclines right into your face, inflight entertainment has long and repeated ads. Fly any other airline to and from India if you can.", "air_title": "Jet Airways ", "Customer_name": "R Shah"}
