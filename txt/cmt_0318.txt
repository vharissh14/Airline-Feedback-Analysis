Unlike the days of BA Miles, any attempt just brings up \"No Availability\" or the web-site simply tries to make you buy an upgrade. Not a good start. Next up, at LAX the plane was a good hour late arriving. Finally boarded and the flight was OK. Food was from the Club World menu (WTP), seating fine, enough wine, good IFE but then, landing late at LHR, a delay because \"An airbus was at our spot\". Next, the airbridge will not work, followed by, an airbus is in our spot. Over 35 minutes wasted, sitting there with children bullying passengers. If the pilot wishes to lie, please be consistent. Route back, all quite normal but I feel somehow, BA have thrown the baby out with the bath water. As a share holder, I prefer discounts to dividends which are doubtful ad I preferred using miles to upgrade (try finding flights from the US you can book with \"Avios\" and finally, why did that pilot lie to all of us, sat there waiting to park? Time to stop collecting miles, change credit cards and look for an honest airline I feel.", "air_title": "British Airways ", "Customer_name": "Bell Neill"}
