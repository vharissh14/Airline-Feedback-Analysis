Overall pleasant flight on the 747-8. Anybody with any financial means should avoid economy. The problem is not with the airline, but the travel companions. The only real drawback are the seats which are too narrow in economy to sit in without severe back pain. I avoided the bathrooms. Luckily, the flight was only 8.5 hours. What surprised me a bit was the shape of some of the interior, knowing that the 747-8 is only around for a short while (carpeting, wall sidings). As usual, the staff is really top notch and worlds apart from US carriers and - sad to say - AF / KLM or BA. This is a different flying experience, though not Singapore quite yet either.", "air_title": "Lufthansa ", "Customer_name": "M Gruenig"}
