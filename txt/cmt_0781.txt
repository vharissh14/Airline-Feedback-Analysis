Probably ranks as one of the worst flights ever - no welcome onboard, plane totally full, however no help from crew in stowing luggage - busy chatting among themselves. Pilot eventually told us they would delay the flight if we did not manage to stow baggage ourselves. Rude and snotty service inflight with no smiles. Seats uncomfortable and too short. In addition to that all flight delayed as usual. LH is going downhill.", "air_title": "Lufthansa ", "Customer_name": "T Mahr"}
