The economy seats were relatively comfortable, but could be a bit softer. The away leg (BA16) was quite good, except for the meal which was barely edible. The flight back had a much improved meal, but the entertainment system had repeated issues, and had to be restarted about 4 times. Another problem with the return leg (BA15) is that, if you get on the plane in Singapore and not in London, by the time online check-in is open for you, there are almost no seats to choose from. I wanted a window seat and had not a single window to choose from at the moment the online check-in opened for me. Service on both flights was good. I was feeling a bit dehydrated and asked for plenty of water on the return flight and had no problems at all. All the staff was nice and accommodating.", "air_title": "British Airways ", "Customer_name": "G Guy"}
