The First Class lounge was a very good, a first class service in full - reception, attendants and attention, breakfast, food, seating, space for working, Wi-Fi. Passport control was taken care and being driven to the gate was a nice touch. Inflight very relaxing, courteous attendants continued and food were really first class, quality and quantity wise. Flight entertainment could be slight better, real bed was excellent, working room as well. Maybe bigger pillows would complement. All in all, excellent first class.", "air_title": "Lufthansa ", "Customer_name": "Bassoli Denisley"}
