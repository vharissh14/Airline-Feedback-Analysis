KWI-BOM - ordinary Boeing 737. No PTVs. Polite Flight Attendants (they have to cater to all kinds in the KWI-BOM sector). Avoided use of washrooms due to co-travellers. Food uneventful. BOM-SIN Airbus and much better flight in terms of seats/ newness of aircraft. Service was good. Food was uneventful - nothing to complain about. PTVs were good and my children enjoyed the programmes. SIN- BNE / BNE-SIN was code share with Qantas - so no comments. SIN-BOM - same as outgoing service. BOM-KWI - still a Boeing but with PTVs. Flight attendants were very good. I do have one complaint and this is not a small one. As mentioned before, I avoid use of toilets during flights from and to the Middle East for obvious reasons. However, the flight had not even taken off and I went to the toilet and found not even a single toilet seat cover. The male flight attendant immediately and promptly cleaned it for me. In other words, no complaints with regards to the flight attendants - but the airline really must provide these basic things on a flight! In all, good value for money.", "air_title": "Jet Airways ", "Customer_name": "S Coutinho"}
