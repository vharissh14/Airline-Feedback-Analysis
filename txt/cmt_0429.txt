LHR-DEL-LHR. Very disappointed. On the outbound flight, the food choice was gone before they reached the 4th row of the economy cabin, meaning that myself and the rest of the cabin had to have the second choice meal - second choice for good reason. It was a truly unpleasant tray of food. The real issue is the introduction of possibly the largest entertainment equipment box in the floor space I have ever seen. It literally takes up half of the floor, and prevents you from stretching both legs out. I don't know if this is exclusive to the refitted B777's, but it is certainly a side effect of the new IFE, and isn't there on the the older cabins. The box seems to be under every window seat on both sides of the cabin. I really don't understand what the cabin designers were thinking allowing this box to take up so much of the space that is already so precious. They could have at least rounded off the corners. It seems rushed and last minute. This means that I am now avoiding BA when booking a trip if they are operating the B777 on the desired route. Bye bye Executive Club silver.", "air_title": "British Airways ", "Customer_name": "D Rahmatallah"}
