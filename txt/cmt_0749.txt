Lufthansa is efficient, and I always prefer flying Lufthansa. Airline staff are generally courteous. Seat comfort and space are excellent. Inflight movie selection was a bit uninteresting. One slight problem, I paid extra for aisle exit seats, but did not receive these on the return flight, likely because I was forced to accept a flight change after the initial ticket was bought.", "air_title": "Lufthansa ", "Customer_name": "Matthew Hollingshead"}
