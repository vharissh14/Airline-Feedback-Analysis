I have been a senator member for many years, and since 1998 I flew practically only with this airline, to my complete satisfaction. In the years I also became an hon club member, thanks to my very frequent flight trips. Now I am retired person, I cannot afford to fly business, and I regularly fly 3-4 times a year either to Brazil or USA to visit my son and daughter. I always book well in advance my flights (the last one of December 16, 2014 was booked on June 6, 2014). To be more comfortable (I have a knee problem) I always try to book emergency seats, and this seems to be almost impossible. I would like to see the airline more sensible to this subject.", "air_title": "Lufthansa ", "Customer_name": "Grimme Franco"}
