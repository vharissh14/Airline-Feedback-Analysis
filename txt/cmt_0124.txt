Flew with my 12 year old daughter, after baggage reclaim, two security checks, check in again and baggage scans, we were put on a coach to transfer to Mumbai domestic. With 25 minutes left for Mumbai Hyderabad flight, I struggled to find the gates, no one knew and there was no Jet staff to help. Finally waited at yet another security queue (no one paged) to arrive at wrong gate where they said I had missed the flight and should go to counters outside who would put me on a flight in next two hours - it was an absolute fish market. They said all flights were full, I should buy a ticket for next day morning and make my own stay arrangements. it took me standing 6 hours of perseverence at the counter pleading, without any food and with my 12 year old in tears. They initially put me on a waiting list and firmed finally with half an hour to go for the flight to Hyderabad which was a Jet Konnect no frills flight where I bought sandwiches and coffee for dinner. Not worth the hassle, I want to give up my Jet Privilege membership and never fly Jet again.", "air_title": "Jet Airways ", "Customer_name": "Sapna Kandukuri"}
