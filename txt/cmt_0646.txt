There was a standard that on Star Alliance flights the gold members got following standard benefits on board. a) Priority boarding, b) personal invitation on board by the steward, c) free seat next to passenger's one to provide more comfort (if possible). On this flight everything was wrong. Boarding was chaotic, there was no priority boarding. No invitation. The flight was not overbooked but stewardess seated another person next to me so she reduced my flight comfort significantly. She could have seated that person easily somewhere else. It didn't happen for the first time. The service standard of Lufthansa has decreased a lot during last 9 months.", "air_title": "Lufthansa ", "Customer_name": "Milan Grohmann"}
