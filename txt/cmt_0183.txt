I was surprised at how dirty the plane was - on 2 of my last three flights, my table was sticky, and the area around me stained. The food quality is generally pretty poor - especially on the Delhi to London leg. Also why not get some decent magazines - Country life, Decanter, the Economist, rather than a dull inflight magazine and a grubby copy of Hello! I residually like BA but they have to up their game.", "air_title": "British Airways ", "Customer_name": "P Seligman"}
