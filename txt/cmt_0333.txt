Lounge in YYZ was nice, pre-flight dinner was just about OK, with modest quality wines offered. Chose an Aisle seat YYZ-LHR, bad idea. Seats are incredibly narrow, not quite wide enough for my shoulders. Tried to sleep, but not possible with in-flight staff constantly leaning across me, lowering the partition and speaking to the Window Seat passenger, who appeared to be a BA staff member who was determined to drink all night. Didn't eat dinner, but breakfast was adequate. Decided on a window seat for the return LHR-YYZ. Bad idea again! Very claustrophobic. During the entire flight I managed to get one small glass of champagne, it was very good. Thereafter, no matter how many times I pressed my call button, no one came, thus nothing more to drink, other than a glass of red wine with my dinner. No offers of cognac or liqueurs. Dinner ingredients were clearly good and well chosen, but everything was so overcooked, it was inedible. When I say over-cooked I mean grey vegetables that disintegrated on your fork and meat that was so dry and stringy that it was actually really unpleasant. Hadn't flown BA for a number of years, and being a Brit, thought it would be a pleasant change from Air Canada on this route. It was a change, but not a pleasant one. It's back to AC for me. Their business class is way better than this experience. Perhaps I was just unfortunate. On the plus side, the aircraft was immaculately clean, clearly quite new, and the inbound flight was spot on time.", "air_title": "British Airways ", "Customer_name": "L Cameron-Lewis"}
