QZ8322, 21 Mar 2014, DMK-CGK (A320). Website check-in is convenient, check-in agents are good and smiling and oblige if you want to change to an Aisle seat. Boarding in DMK is Manual, and the staff check, recheck and re- recheck if you have boarded or not. Crew welcoming and point to your seat. Announcements so fast, no one can understand them. Safety demonstrations are very good and clear to the point. Food looks like it has been recycled on 2 or more flights, I had pre-booked meal (Pak Nassers Nasi Lemak) as I'm allergic to fish, however the meal included Anchovies. Again on landing the announcements were so fast that we all just looked at each other in a daze. Overall I will fly them again, but will bring my own food and water.", "air_title": "AirAsia ", "Customer_name": "Sandesh Kshatriya"}
