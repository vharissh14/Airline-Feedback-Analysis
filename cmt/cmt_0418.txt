The airline and staff were fantastic from check in to baggage collection. Can't recommend highly enough. Paid for the Red Carpet option in Bali and this was well worth the $30.00 dollars. The lounge was great as was the complimentary food and drink. We flew with Qantas from Melbourne to Perth and compared to Air Asia they were sadly lacking.", "air_title": "AirAsia ", "Customer_name": "Michael Brien"}
