I flew the same route with Qatar in 2011 and was really impressed with the service at the time, so was looking forward to the same thing this time travelling with my wife. On the day of our departure I was somewhat disappointed that due to a change of plane from A340 to A330 on the LHR-DOH leg, my reserved seats no longer applied and we were stuck over the wing, however, we had at least been given seats together. It\u0092s fair to say that our impression of Qatar\u0092s in-flight experience for the whole of the first three legs (that is, to Chennai and back to Doha on return) was good. All were on A330s (either -200 or -300s). The planes were comfortable with good leg-room (although beware of the entertainment box which takes up half the foot-space for all window seats), the cabin crew were attentive, polite and friendly, the food was impressively above average \u0096 all the seats seemed to have been refurbished on our planes and were comfortable. As for the new Doha airport, even though we only had a 1 hour transit each way, it was clearly outstanding with plenty of space to relax, use the internet, watch TV and many shops, albeit expensive ones. Overall the impression was very good, though I would have said it had lost that real supreme feel that had so impressed me in 2011. Then, on our final leg from Doha \u0096 Heathrow I had managed to book this leg on the new A380. Suddenly the wow-factor returned! By some distance the best flight we have ever taken! Our seats had again been changed, but boy were we glad! Between booking and flying I'd joined the Qatar Privilege Club and we\u0092d been moved to the small economy section at the back of the top deck, which had been fully blocked out when I reserved seats. Instead of 3-4-3 seating, it\u0092s 2-4-2 and the experience was great. Comfortable seats, lots of legroom, big HD quality IFE screens, fantastic service from 2 dedicated cabin crew and 2 toilets for just 8 rows of seats, storage box next to the window, complimentary mini amenity kit for all economy passengers and of course that great feeling of walking up the stairs inside the plane to reach our seats. The fact that its such a small section of economy makes it feel pretty exclusive too. In economy? Fly the A380 if you can!", "air_title": "Qatar Airways ", "Customer_name": "J Keep"}
