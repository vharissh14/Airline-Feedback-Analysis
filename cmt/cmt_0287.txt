I found Singapore Airlines still to be a cut above the rest - but not perfect - and wouldn't hesitate to use again. Main leg on way out was on a modern 777, very nice and clearly more space than competition due to 3-3-3 layout - food all good and I can't remember any other carrier proactively offering so many drinks and refills in Economy. However the Singapore to Manila leg (and same coming back) was a much older 777 cabin with mediocre screens etc. Still no complaints as the equivalent leg on Malaysian (comparable due to distance) is on a real shocker of a 737. On way back my video screen was down for the whole flight and the staff asked me to stay behind to speak to the customer service team at Changi for 'compensation' - they gave me some kind of wallet which was a nice touch but not worth waiting behind on an empty plane for. Singapore to London on A380 upstairs - great flight and great space. All 4 flights were delayed which was frustrating but hey not the airlines' fault. Generally - the long haul legs very impressive, the shorter flights average but overall far better than any other route to the Philippines. One frustration is security rules at the gate at Changi - confiscating water bought 2 minutes before at the airport which seems excessive.", "air_title": "Singapore Airlines ", "Customer_name": "James Wall"}
