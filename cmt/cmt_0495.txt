The first flight was a Boeing 777 and the second an Airbus A-320. The first flight was one of the best I have had after a bad start. An angry inconsiderate passenger in front of me refused to put up his seat while lunch was served and was incredibly rude to me and the cabin attendant. The cabin attendant suggested I move to an empty emergency door seat which I did and had lots of legroom. The plane was immaculate as was the service. The second flight to Kathmandu was also excellent in every way. Both flights were on time and all flight attendants that I could see were extremely professional, helpful and friendly. I highly recommend this airline to all. I am now looking forward to flying on the Airbus A-350.", "air_title": "Qatar Airways ", "Customer_name": "Anthony M Slark"}
