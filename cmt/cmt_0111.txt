This trip better - main issue is just age of seats, cramped cabin, and mean amenities eg: no paper cups in toilets, often no paper towels, only tissues. AV is very poor quality and selection. Staff very pleasant, food on this leg was better than ex Singapore.", "air_title": "Air France ", "Customer_name": "C Galloway"}
