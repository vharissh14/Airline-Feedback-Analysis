Flight departed and arrived on time. Service was average - good but not excellent. Perhaps it has to do with the full load. Aircraft was alternating between very cold and very hot throughout the flight. Restrooms were clean, IFE working perfectly and food was standard. The major flaw was the seat pitch. Couldn't remember the last time I took SQ's A330, but the seat pitch was way smaller than even ANA Domestic, which I took twice during this trip. It was very cramped.", "air_title": "Singapore Airlines ", "Customer_name": "Lau Ni"}
