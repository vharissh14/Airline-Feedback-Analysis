Have to say I was thoroughly impressed. Yes, the service wasn't fantastic from all the cabin crew. Yes, the meals weren't fine dining, yes, improvements can be made but if my 4 legs of this trip is anything to go from I would definitely recommend Emirates A380 services to others. We sat all 4 legs in 59 ABC in order to have the most stable journey so didn't test the levels down the length of this massive aircraft, however what we received was extremely good and am looking at booking again for this 22 hour journey with Emirates on the A380. If I were to be critical then improving the food offering would be good and using \"secret shoppers\" to test flight attendants would help, I interacted with around 20 flight attendants during these 4 legs and 18 were great, it's funny how 2 from 20 will stick out more in my mind. Emirates need to be careful with traffic flow as we had an hour circling prior to landing in Dubai due to congestion and then 3 hours later had an hour sat on stand waiting for a slot due to congestion. In essence I'd definitely recommend the Emirates A380 service, safety and comfort are first rate and with a few improvements I'd say even economy is first class!", "air_title": "Emirates ", "Customer_name": "Jon Aindow"}
