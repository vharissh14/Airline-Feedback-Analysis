Our inflight entertainment system did not work. The staff tried resetting it, but this did not cure the problem. Eventually I was offered another seat, which I declined as we were travelling as a couple, I did not wish to move without my husband. When the hot meal was served, we choose the chicken, which was cold. Mentioned this to the staff, who offered another meal, but declined this. Beware, they have got too big to care.", "air_title": "Emirates ", "Customer_name": "Liz Sowerby"}
