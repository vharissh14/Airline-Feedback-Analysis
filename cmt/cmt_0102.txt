Food from Paris was really good and quite poor from the US to Paris. Decent French wines, champagne and Spirits from MSP. Weirdly I was told that they only had wine and port for flights to Montreal. Service from CDG-YUL was a joke, not even a drink served until we were over Irish airspace, such a disorganized serving of dinner it was laughable. Attendants were stumbling over them selves serving trays and than I just got one passed to me from behind with no words or choices, but it was very tasty and the portions were just right. All other requests were self-serving. The 777-300 was horrible, no legroom and very cramped, A340 old and falling apart but much more comfortable with the exception of the middle 4 seats, they were empty but fixed armrests prevented you from getting comfortable and sleeping flat. Bring a book or ipad as the IFE on the A340 is rubbish. I would fly again if the price is right, don't expect too much and you might get lucky.", "air_title": "Air France ", "Customer_name": "D Peters"}
