Our first sector from Sydney to Singapore was good, seat comfort was good, food was good for economy, IFE was average since it wasn't the SIA KrisWorld flagship system. Singapore to Manila was good flight, A330, full flight. Security and boarding was slow (typical for Manila bound flights however), however it was SIA's Economy product seen on the A380. Returning back to Sydney, the Singapore to Manila leg was on a older B777 aircraft, with an old IFE system with loop programming, food was good and seat comfort was good. Our final leg to Sydney was on an A380, on the upper deck. The flight wasn't full, and the cabin crew during pushback, invited us to come downstairs and check out an empty row, so we got a row to ourselves and it was a very comfortable trip back to Sydney. IFE was good, food was good, however a bit disappointed with the continental breakfast which was essentially a fruit and muffin. Service overall was excellent, same high standard that Singapore Airlines provides, and the flights ran on time, some flights arriving earlier than scheduled. Price was great, and would definitely recommend SIA to anyone travelling.", "air_title": "Singapore Airlines ", "Customer_name": "Andrew Rumpel"}
