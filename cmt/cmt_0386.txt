I booked the Premium Flex fare to enjoy the extras, such as 20kg checked baggage and priority seating. Online booking is straightforward, if a bit annoying due to the many forced opt-out options one has to explicitly decline. Web check-in, however, started to be positively jarring: mobile boarding pass didn't work with a European cell number, the airport kiosk can't reprint an already issued boarding pass and the whole experience gets very frustrating very soon. Ground staff were helpful, but this is too little to overcome the system's shortcomings. Priority boarding is a myth at LOP, as there is only a single security line at the gate, which opened extremely late. That way, everyone finds themselves standing in a long line with no seating, while hundreds of empty seats wait inside the gate area. I ended up boarding among the last, just to fight for some overhead bin space and reclaim my assigned seat. FAs didn't really seem very engaged, and it took some doing to get their attention just to purchase a drink onboard. The flight was okay, but the general feel is of a barebone service.", "air_title": "AirAsia ", "Customer_name": "Juraj Kovac"}
