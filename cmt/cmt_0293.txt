I had the pleasure of flying for the first time, not only to New Zealand from Heathrow but with Singapore Airlines. I just had to write to say how excellent my flying time was. I was made to feel safe, secure, welcome and as if I was the only passenger on the plane. Nothing was too much trouble. The staff were immaculate in all areas of appearance. A great flight.", "air_title": "Singapore Airlines ", "Customer_name": "Pauline Mary Vind"}
