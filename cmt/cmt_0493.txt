The Dreamliner was most disappointing. Noisy Cabin. Narrow seats, no leg room. And if you are above 5'10, you will struggle to squeeze in. Food portions were very small, plastic fork and spoons, mediocre and slow service. On a 8+ hour flight, only served drinks once. Flights on all sectors were on time. Ran out of non-veg food on two sectors. Crew seemed amateur and clumsy. Except on the Jo'burg-Doha sector which was a daytime flight where the crew were cheerful and friendly, they were grumpy on all other sectors. In between meals snacks were just a small packet of chips or chocolate. Snack with drinks only given on the Jo'burg-Doha sector were tasteless, small bread sticks with a horrible salsa. Nuts would have been a 100 times better. Old hindi movies and very limited choice on TV channels. Never again on QR.", "air_title": "Qatar Airways ", "Customer_name": "Valentine Mendanha"}
