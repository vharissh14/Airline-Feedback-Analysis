Another bug I have with Air Asia is that they do not notify passengers of flight changes, dates etc. They simply change itineraries and let passengers find out themselves. I have flown with them for 7 years and I'm losing patience at the way they do not care for passengers who support them. They are not cheap anymore. Scoot are far more reliable and a similar price ex Sydney. Once my pre-booked flights for 2015 are used, it's bye bye to Air Asia, for me. Too little, too late! 50% good is not good enough!", "air_title": "AirAsia ", "Customer_name": "L Evans"}
