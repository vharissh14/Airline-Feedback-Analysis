A380 economy seat is comfortable and spacious, AVOD is fantastic. Good quality food and wine. No water/drinks served during the dinner and breakfast and you need go to galley to get water by yourself. CDG-VIE on A320, nothing to say as its European short-haul flight.", "air_title": "Air France ", "Customer_name": "Steven Cao"}
