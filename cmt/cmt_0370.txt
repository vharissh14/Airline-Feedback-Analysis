We were very pleasantly surprised at the amount of space and the ability to turn the seat into an almost flat bed, albeit the incline was just enough to make sliding down the seat a bit of a problem. The service was excellent and whilst the food was quite basic and they had not got our pre ordered meals correct the food was adequate. The inflight entertainment was also quite basic but as we had been warned of this we had our own tablets etc so we certainly did not suffer. As far as value for money goes I could not have wished for a better experience. We will certainly use this airline again where possible.", "air_title": "AirAsia ", "Customer_name": "Joe Ryan"}
