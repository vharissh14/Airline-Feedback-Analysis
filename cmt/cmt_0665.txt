Seated in exit row 52, although some kind of fridge malfunction had soaked the floor, so we had to use blankets in order not to get wet - it being a full flight and already in exit row wasn't really going to give it up. Food was slightly disappointing - still perfectly edible but nothing special. IFE was great for TV, loads of series, but fewer movies. Inflight WIFI is a nice touch, although it took me 10 hours to log on. I sent them a complaint email about the wet floor during the flight which I think is pretty good. Overall - the Qantas-Emirates tie up is great for Europe to Australia, especially with the overnight timings of the flights, and A380's going all directions. Emirates also a solid choice for service.", "air_title": "Emirates ", "Customer_name": "J Howsam"}
