Both legs with window seats. Staff and service excellent, food (Asian option), choices, excellent and delicious. Plentiful water, juice and hot drinks between meals as well as light bites. Hot towels before each meal. IFE selection gargantuan, with superb, easy to use handset. Seats outbound far more comfortable than on the return sector. For service and inflight experiences, one of the nicest I have enjoyed, definitely the carrier of choice to South East Asia and Changi airport is a thing of beauty.", "air_title": "Singapore Airlines ", "Customer_name": "T Sellicks"}
