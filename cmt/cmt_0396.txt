Flew from Kuala Lumpur to Sydney. Then from Melbourne to Singapore in April 2014. The second flight was cancelled at the last minute so obliged to take midnight flight. Hours standing in a queue to check in luggage. Seats narrow and uncomfortable. No entertainment. Food and drink expensive with little choice.", "air_title": "AirAsia ", "Customer_name": "Janet Andrews"}
