Seat 27G. I chose seat 46c because of its position forward of the leading edge of the wing, which on other 380's such as Emirates and Singapore, are both relatively quiet and comfortable in turbulence. This new position was noisy (engine) and dreadful in turbulence, because you are so close to the tail. I understand airlines cannot guarantee your seat request \"for technical reasons\" but there was nothing wrong with the seat I had chosen. My guess is that as a solo traveller, I was probably moved to accommodate a group of two or more travellers that left there checking in and seat reservations until the last minute. I would love to know why people who book flights five or six moths in advance, should be penalised for others that either book last minute, or don't check in until the last minute. I was told by the cabin purser, that the ground staff had moved many people and that that many passengers had complained.", "air_title": "Qatar Airways ", "Customer_name": "Bob Mitchell"}
