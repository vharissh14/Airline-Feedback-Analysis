Overall experience was disappointing. However, I arrived on time and I had plenty of legroom due to the seat (10J). But the onboard service was nearly non-existent, no response whatsoever after ringing the attendant button. Entertainment system crashed every 5 minutes. No drinks offered, only with the distribution of (mediocre) food. Orly airport staff were slow, rude and unfriendly.", "air_title": "Air France ", "Customer_name": "A Brandsma"}
