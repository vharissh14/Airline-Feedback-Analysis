Business seat on the 777 far superior compared to the rather cramped and angled 330. What I liked on the 777 seat is the fact that there is plenty of space and no \"foot box\" so you can sleep in any position and have freedom of movement. The 330 had the \"foot box\" which restricts movement and is quite annoying and doesn't go flat. Service on all sectors was excellent as was food and wines. Couldn't fault the staff at all. Having a 7 hour layover on the outbound trip we went on the free Doha city tour which was well worth it. Back in time to relax for a couple of hours in the enormous lounge. Would recommend Qatar but beware of travelling on the cramped 330 business class which is ok for a day flight but not a night flight.", "air_title": "Qatar Airways ", "Customer_name": "David Gilbert"}
