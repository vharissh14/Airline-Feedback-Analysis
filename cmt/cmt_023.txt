Excellent trip, even though flight full. Two female flight attendants the best I have ever encountered on any flight, they were helpful and professional, engaging in conversation with passengers. Although it was the old style seating I found it comfortable and slept well. Food was good. Air France is highly recommended.", "air_title": "Air France ", "Customer_name": "H Williams"}
