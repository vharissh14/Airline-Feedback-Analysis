Positives were cost, clean aircraft and a good selection of flight times. However, I was concerned with the level of hygiene in the toilets. On both flights soap was not provided which essentially means that nobody was able to wash their hands properly which is poor infection control particularly when there are 180 people confined to a small space for a long period of time. Flight attendants and crew could be more clearer on the PA system as well. Food good but a lot cheaper if pre ordered.", "air_title": "AirAsia ", "Customer_name": "M Fallows"}
