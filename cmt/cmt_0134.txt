The review is based on all 4 flights as there was little to choose between them. The service was consistency high; attentive, friendly and helpful The best I have flown and I am a regular traveller. The only disappointment for me was that the Book the cook meals were somewhat disappointing. I would have been better off with the standard meals. My wife found the beds hard and difficult to lie diagonally but they were fine for me. I would choose Singapore every time if I could.", "air_title": "Singapore Airlines ", "Customer_name": "Smith Barrie"}
