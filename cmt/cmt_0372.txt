Cabin consists of 12 seats only so is nice and quiet. Seats are cocoon style. backs do not recline, but the seat does all the work, thus you never have anyone in front reclining their seat in your face. Nice big pillows and doonas complete the feeling of luxury. Meals are not a highlight however. We find comfort far more important than meals. One good thing about the meal service however is you can tell the cabin crew when you would like to eat. If you want a comfortable few hours sleep where you can stretch full length, and cuddle up in a doona can thoroughly recommend Air Asia Business Class. Aircraft clean and crew very helpful.", "air_title": "AirAsia ", "Customer_name": "Janet Fitzgerald Wheeler"}
