It appears to me the airline is cutting corners and not keeping up with the ME carriers. The seat, although wide, is not particularly comfortable in the seated position. The fully reclined position was better but the bed was hard. They would do well to add a comforter on the sleeping surface to provide a softer experience. They used to provide an amenities kit- no longer. The food too was just not as good as it used to be. If they want to retain their ratings they better spend a bit more on their business class product.", "air_title": "Singapore Airlines ", "Customer_name": "L Berney"}
