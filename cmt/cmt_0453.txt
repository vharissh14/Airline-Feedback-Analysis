Two window seats towards the rear of an Airbus A330. The toilet closest to us had no water, something that became apparent halfway through the flight after at least 60 or 70 people had already used it. Seat legroom was good and meals OK, although we did get 2 rounds of drinks with dinner, the crew in our aisle ignored us on at least two occasions. We were asked to give up blankets for people who needed extra ones! IFE worked via the touch screen only, my handset was not functioning. On time, food adequate but certainly nothing special. The exterior camera on take off and landing was however a nice touch!", "air_title": "Kingfisher Airlines ", "Customer_name": "D Barker"}
