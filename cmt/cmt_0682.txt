Emirates A380 is a brilliant product. I flew economy - and it was arguably the best cabin experience. Spacious, great inflight entertainment, comfortable seat, amazingly lit cabin at night and great food. It was really difficult to fault. The staff were friendly and helpful, got some great sleep on the flight too - and there's really not much else to say! Would highly recommend.", "air_title": "Emirates ", "Customer_name": "L Jarvis"}
