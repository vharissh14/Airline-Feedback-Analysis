SQ422, 8th July, BNE-BOM. SQ421, 17th July, BOM-SIN. SQ255, 18th July, SIN-BNE. I have been flying with SQ for the last 5 years. They have excellent service, staff and crew members and a great on-time performance record! Some aircraft's are a bit old (example: Boeing 777-200ER that flies between SYD and BOM). The screen resolution and quality is quite poor on this aircraft, but the crew members are friendly and great to talk to if you don't want to watch movies/TV.", "air_title": "Singapore Airlines ", "Customer_name": "Nagarkar Ameya"}
