Flight departed slightly late, but arrived on time. Great service and seat - amazingly comfortable seat. The only downside is the lack of storage. Could only store handbag under the ottoman. IFE choices were extensive and updated. Was given free 15MB WiFi. Pre-ordered Book the Cook's Lobster Thermidor and it deserves its online reputation. The rest of the courses were mediocre - more like Business Class food. Service was excellent, as expected of SQ, except that the FA forgot to return me my coat at the end of the flight, causing me to walk halfway to Arrival, only to turn back upon realizing my forgotten coat.", "air_title": "Singapore Airlines ", "Customer_name": "Lau Ni"}
