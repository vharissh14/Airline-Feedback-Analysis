As stated by others on this site, they consistently block you from checking in online and pre-paying your bags. So, on a domestic flight from Phuket to Bangkok, instead of $330 baht per bag (about $10-11 US per bag), we had to pay a whopping $900 per bag (about $30 US per bag!) and it was their fault that we couldn't follow their procedure to check-in and pre-pay online. If you are sick (like I was) on the flight don't expect an air sickness bag in the pocket at your seat, nor a blanket, you have to buy the blanket. The flight was chaotic! There were toddlers running up and down the aisles screaming the entire flight with the flight attendants allowing it, never mind the danger to the children! In-flight entertainment? None. Spend the extra and fly a real airline.", "air_title": "AirAsia ", "Customer_name": "R West"}
