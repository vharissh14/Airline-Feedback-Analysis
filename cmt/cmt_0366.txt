I bought the tickets during a promo sale, so paid very little. All went well. Flights were on time. It was a holiday weekend on the way out, so the flight was full. Coming back things were less hectic as it was a normal weekday. I chose a lunch time flight so we could use a taxi to the airport easily. Check in was quick and the flight went on time. The pre-booked meals were all as expected. Seats were free up the back and we were allowed to use them and spread out. Arrival at KLIA2 was easy as we'd used the airport before. Air Asia offers a great product. You know what you'll get, and so long as you buy during a promo period, you'll pay very little.", "air_title": "AirAsia ", "Customer_name": "P Elliott"}
