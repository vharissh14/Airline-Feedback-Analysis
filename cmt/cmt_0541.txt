I was smoothly upgraded by miles from their Frequent Flyer Program using \u0093QCredits. This was the only leg on business class (out of 4) enabling me to compare with economy. The A330-200 on SGN-DOH business class seats are flat but not fully horizontal (only decline to 165 degrees), making sleeping horrible. Night-kit and nice cotton pyjamas provided. Service top notch and wines in ultra-top class! Food served on demand and excellent but portions have become very small recently and 2-3 dishes are needed to make up a full meal. FA's the most professional, alert, and caring I have experienced for long time. Now 4 beers to choose among and the 2 champagne offered are exclusive, though still beaten by some of the wines served. Cheese plates nice. Granted access to Business class lounge in Doha despite onwards travel was only in economy.", "air_title": "Qatar Airways ", "Customer_name": "Anders Pedersen"}
