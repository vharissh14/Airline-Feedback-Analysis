Had a seat in Row 36 and as part of the boarding process was made to stand in a queue (one for different sets of rows) for forty minutes. This is a ridiculous ground staff strategy to ensure organised boarding. Considering the flight duration is ~4 hours with a pre 5 a.m. landing, the cabin lights were on for most of the flight for catering and duty-free shopping. For a 5-star airline, the handling of boarding and the management of the cabin left a lot to be desired.", "air_title": "Singapore Airlines ", "Customer_name": "Krishnan Chitoor"}
