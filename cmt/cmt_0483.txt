Was booked on the new A350 with flat beds. Two days before the flight, plane was swapped to an A330 with ski slope beds. This is the third time I have had an aircraft substitution to an inferior product with Qatar. Until they can standardise their Business Class product to that of their 787's/A380's I would not recommend them as what product you receive on the day you fly seems a total lottery. If a flat bed and sleep is a priority for you, avoid.", "air_title": "Qatar Airways ", "Customer_name": "D Jason"}
