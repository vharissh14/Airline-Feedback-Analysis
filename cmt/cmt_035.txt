Family of four. Despite having heard negative reviews in the past about flying via CDG, and not speaking French, it turned out to be relatively easy. The Cabin Crew on all sectors were very pleasant and attentive. Inflight catering was to a high standard. The only issue was on the return sector when one of our three bags did not arrive at our final destination. In fairness our connection was booked by myself and was just over one hour. I received a text immediately on arrival at EDI informing me of the missing bag and also various updates during the day with regard to it's delivery status. It was delivered to our home 8 hours after our arrival. I was impressed with this level of communication. In summary we found Air France to be very good and certainly value for money. We will use them again.", "air_title": "Air France ", "Customer_name": "S Gates"}
