It seems that SQ has decided not to upgrade the IFE on this retrofit thus the movie selection is not as grand, the user interface is old and the pix quality of the screen is lower. I have always loved the SQ biz class seat for I find it a good balance between privacy and comfort. The meals were superb as was the service.", "air_title": "Singapore Airlines ", "Customer_name": "Tercon Bojan"}
