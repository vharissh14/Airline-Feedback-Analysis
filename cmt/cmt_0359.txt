Check in was quick - my bag was over the 20 kg limit so they let me re- pack and carry on a 2nd carry-on, the signs all over say \"only 1 carry-on allowed\" but I never saw anyone say anything to customers with multiple carry-on bags. Agents were friendly both on the ground and in the air. Inbound flight was late an hour so departure was delayed the same time, ground staff announced the delay just at the time we would have been departing. Think its a standard of Air Asia to not announce delays promptly. Flight was good - 2 hours and again a seat in the middle free. Bought noodles and snacks - good value for money and delicious. Landed at KUL Terminal 2 about 45 minutes late and bags came out fairly quickly. Enjoyed the flight and definitely a good fare.", "air_title": "AirAsia ", "Customer_name": "D Graubard"}
