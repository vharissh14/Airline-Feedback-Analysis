Very friendly crew, very welcoming and helpful. Hot towels before take off, nice food and a good range of snacks available at any time. Good range of TV programmes and films that keep you entertained. Blankets, socks and headphones provided on each flight. Seats not particularly big with only slightly more leg room than a short haul flight, but still fairly comfortable. Always on time, with no problems/delays. Overall, a great airline with a great service! Would definitely recommend.", "air_title": "Singapore Airlines ", "Customer_name": "S Hanvey"}
