QR840 on 15/3/15. QR841 on 28/3/15. QR21 on 29/3/15. Just had four flights using Qatar, 1st Manchester to Doha, new Airbus 330, good comfortable seats, IFE system good, USB port on all seat backs. Food and drinks service good lots of soft drinks and water throughout the flight. 2nd Doha to Phuket, old airbus 330, seats ok but old and starting to wear thin. IFE again ok but using old system, food and drink service good. 3rd Phuket to Doha, old 330, seats poor legs and bum numb after 2 hours no support or comfort, IFE old system, food very poor, drinks ok when requested. 4th Doha to Manchester, Very old 330 seat comfort very poor, food poor, water and soft drinks only on request, IFE old system and kept failing (freezing) also very difficult to hear as there was so much background noise from the aircraft engines. Overall not very good experience standards have dropped so much since the last time we used Qatar (2013) think they are living on past reputations.", "air_title": "Qatar Airways ", "Customer_name": "Nicholson David"}
