Having contacted their customer services before our flight I have to say the service was excellent. We travelled on a A380 airbus and we sat upstairs. Comfort, leg room, food and service during our flight were better than we have experienced with any other airline. We travelled to Bangkok via Singapore and our return was from Hanoi via Singapore. We sat in 78ac and 72 ac on our return. The service was excellent. Our luggage was transferred to our final destination. All staff on the flight were kind, helpful and made the journey a pleasure. Well done Singapore Airlines we would definitely fly with them again.", "air_title": "Singapore Airlines ", "Customer_name": "Jill Whitehead"}
