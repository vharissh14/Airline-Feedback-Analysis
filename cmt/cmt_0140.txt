March 9, 2015 (SQ 917) and March 11, 2015 (SQ 918). Singapore Airline's service is more impressive than the last airline I took before. I got this flight 50% off from its original price from a promo, so when they go on sale, Singapore Airlines is more than value for your money. Even if they aren't on sale, they are reasonably priced with the service and freebies they give. They have free- flowing drinks, their food is impressively close to a fine dining experience and their staff is very friendly and approachable. Their inflight entertainment is good, but the seat's legroom is a bit cramped.", "air_title": "Singapore Airlines ", "Customer_name": "M Huang"}
