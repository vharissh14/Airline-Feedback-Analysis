AF1844. I have never before encountered service in business class as so poor, and an inflight experience as negative as I did on my recent flights: uncomfortable seats (in fact business class seat were economy class seats separated by one non-occupied seat. The entire meal was served on a single tray under a plastic film, like in economy class. Entertainment were not available. The return flight Moscow-Paris on Aeroflot was significantly better!", "air_title": "Air France ", "Customer_name": "Daniel Dessort"}
