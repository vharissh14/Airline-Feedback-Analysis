Very cramped, crew were stressed and managed on a 10 hr flight between meals to come by one time only with water. Very uncomfortable, bad connections of headphones and no excuse for delay. Not even 'we hope to welcome you on board of one of our flights again'. Well that explains all, sad experience.", "air_title": "Air France ", "Customer_name": "E Oplaat"}
