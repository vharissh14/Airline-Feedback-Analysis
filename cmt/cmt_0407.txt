The flights were fine, on time and pleasant for the fare paid. However, two weeks ago received an email from Air Asia stating that my return KUL-PER flight 26 May has been cancelled - 'for commercial reasons'. Checking their website, this particular 0850 KUL departure for Perth no longer appears. So, they have just cancelled the flight because the were not enough passengers. As a result, instead of a 2 hour connection in KUL, I now have an 18 hour connection at KUL. No compensation offered or even interest in the gross inconvenience to passengers who have booked and paid on the basis of a reasonable connection. What can one do for 18 hours with a 2 year old child at KUL? Their customer service is simply mealy mouthed excuses and the claim that a stopover hotel is 'not within their service recovery'. Service recover for whom? Formerly loyal Air Asia customers. No longer.", "air_title": "AirAsia ", "Customer_name": "Michiyo Gibson"}
