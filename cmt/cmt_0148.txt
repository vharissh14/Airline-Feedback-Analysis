B777-200 on both legs. What can I say about Singapore Airlines? Impeccable service from the minute you board to the minute you get off the plane. Hot towels were served shortly after boarding, followed by drinks and dinner. Very courteous and pleasant crew members. Dinner choices on the PER-SIN leg were limited to Pork Stew and Stir fried beef, but they were not too bad. Breakfast was served on the SIN-BOM leg, with a choice of Indian crepes or baked eggs with chicken sausage and baked beans. The aircraft's are showing signs of ageing though as some PTVs were not working, and a couple of seats in the middle row seem to have had reclining problems. Overall, a very pleasant experience, and it's always a pleasure to fly Singapore Airlines.", "air_title": "Singapore Airlines ", "Customer_name": "G Parkhi"}
