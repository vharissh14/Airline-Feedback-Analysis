But yesterday I arrived back in Perth from Dubai on an 11-hour flight on the same Boeing 777-300ER, and my coccyx and lower back are still aching from the narrow seating. I can only say, I am going to carefully consider my next flight, maybe even save up for 2nd class. Cattle class is just that, I am not obese, but have wide hips and shoulders and I am above average height. The seats on the Boeing 777-300ER were a good 2.5 inches narrower than on the remainder of my particular flight ( Dubai London), legroom is less and the back can only be minimally adjusted. Sleep is impossible. Service was very average, crew seemed to be permanently engaged in jockeying their unwieldy carts in that narrower passage-ways, food options ran out quickly. The entertainment options do not make up for the unpleasantness of the entire experience. Of course, comfort is supplied to the higher-paying customers. I really do resent this! Will try and check out the plane-type before flying again.", "air_title": "Emirates ", "Customer_name": "Slany Gertrude"}
