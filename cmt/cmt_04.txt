Service: Male cabin crew were rude and unhelpful. After the first meal there is no sign of crew for around 7 hours. No drinks offered. Food is poor. TV was broken. Asked to have it looked at. Never happened. Based on what my partner could see there were very few options and few recent films. Old aircraft with old seat. Very disappointed by this flight.", "air_title": "Air France ", "Customer_name": "J Leverton"}
