Strange routing through my booking agent to save money meant 15 hours in the air. LHR- Dubai in A380-aisle seat at back of cabin. Enough leg room, food OK, crew OK. Dubai-Lagos, 777-300 ER, cramped seats very hard, very uncomfortable, full plane. Airlines seem to have thrown out 2-4-2 seating in favour of skinny light weight seats-narrow aisles and lack of comfort. Food and crew OK. Return leg Lagos-Dubai, 777-300-older plane still with cramped 3-4-3 seats. Aisle seat at back of plane gives a bit more leg room. Dubai- LHR return leg Airbus A380, seat 81 A-more leg room but armrest does not lift so you have little sideways room. Food - lamb was awful, crew were good. All flights on time. No breakfast served on Lagos-Dubai leg due to turbulence-never heard that one before.", "air_title": "Emirates ", "Customer_name": "D Taylor"}
