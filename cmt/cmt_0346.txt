Got a cheap deal as I booked months ahead. Both trips were very pleasant and the female air crew were very pleasant and efficient. Not too sure about the male crew as I only saw them sitting down or eating as their female colleagues worked. The Business Class seats were very comfortable and a pillow and duvet was provided. Food was warm and served at the time you requested. Ground crew in KL kept customers waiting for more than 20 mins as they served 1 customer with issues. Common sense would dictate that this customer be served separately and kept the line moving. Staff were very strict with luggage allowance as I saw many people re-packing at the counters. A good trip and I would fly Air Asia again.", "air_title": "AirAsia ", "Customer_name": "T Lee"}
