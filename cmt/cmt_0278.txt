Fantastic airline despite using old equipment (777-200) for the regional route. Kids meals very tasty that even my daughter who is a very picky eater had no problems finishing the generous portions. Specialised headsets for the kids as well as some activity materials too. IFE acceptable, and adequate to keep the young ones entertained for the 3 hour flight. Well worth the money.", "air_title": "Singapore Airlines ", "Customer_name": "M Mejia"}
