Four Emirates Flights in the last 6 days. First sector from Dublin to Dubai was astonishingly poor for an airline as reputable as Emirates. Chaotic boarding, late departure - 1hr 10 minute delay. Staff onboard were generally surly, abrupt, extremely rude and unhelpful. One particular stewardess on this flight demonstrably lacked the people and interpersonal skills required to carry out her responsibilities. The aircraft's ICE system was particularly ineffective and difficult to navigate. However, the further three flights resonated as if it were a completely different airline. Staff were utterly professional, courteous, caring and engaging throughout. The PEK-DBX flight epitomised the standard for exemplary customer service in every way, albeit helped by the fantastic A380-800 aircraft used on this sector. Despite the first let-down, Emirates will be my airline of choice for any future longhaul international travel.", "air_title": "Emirates ", "Customer_name": "J Fox"}
