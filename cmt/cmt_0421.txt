Return flight to Singapore for a day trip. $40 return, so cant complain about the price. No issues with check in on both legs. Fairly new A320s, which for some reason had very old worn seats (maybe moved from their older retired aircraft). That is probably the only minor complaint. Cabin crew friendly and efficient, managed to serve meals and drinks and clean up on a very short 45 min flight. Both flights landed on time. Over all a good experience, would fly with them again.", "air_title": "AirAsia ", "Customer_name": "S Grigoriev"}
