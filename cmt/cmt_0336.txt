The first flight was on a new A330-300, the second on an almost as new Boeing 777-300 ER. Both flights were just superb. The cabin crew, as ever, were attentive friendly and professional. The food on both flights was very good, even though we were in cattle class. We have used them many times to Australia and they are always excellent.", "air_title": "Singapore Airlines ", "Customer_name": "D Meredith"}
