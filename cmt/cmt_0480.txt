Early check in at Heathrow and returning at Kathmandu meant we had extra leg room seats on all sectors there and back. Drinks service was wonderful and you can have what you want, I was allowed to have champagne with my dinner. The food choice was lovely and tasty. The staff could not do enough for the passengers, I have to say I would recommend and definitely fly with Qatar again. If I had any advice I would say they needed another set of toilets on the planes and I found the seats a little tight, although I am a large man and I had extra legroom so it did not matter.", "air_title": "Qatar Airways ", "Customer_name": "Pilkington David"}
