Check in staff and flight attendants on all trips were very professional and helpful. Air con hardly worked between Brisbane and Singapore and was most uncomfortable. Also very disappointed (and annoyed) when offered peanuts as a snack despite telling the airline that I was anaphylactic to peanuts! After telling the flight attendant he was most apologetic and gave me and my family potato chips instead. Overall the meals were ok - especially good from Paris! Flew on the A380 between Singapore and Paris and there was plenty of room so were able to spread out and have a proper sleep! Flight attendants were most attentive and seemed to rush up and offer you more food or drink as soon as you showed any sign of waking up. Overall quite a good experience and I would recommend this airline!", "air_title": "Singapore Airlines ", "Customer_name": "K Evo"}
