Outward flights around 30-40% full and close to 100% on the return. Food poor on the MEL-SIN leg but enjoyable on the remainder. Excellent cabin service by friendly, proactive staff including numerous water& juice runs on all legs. Return flights both delayed by around 15 minutes due to luggage having to be removed after 'no-shows'. A good selection on the entertainment system although there were some lags and occasional freezing on the flights to and from KIX. The aircraft interiors all seemed to be in good condition and the seating comfortable despite the seat pitch being a bit tighter than I remember experiencing the last time we flew with the Airline.", "air_title": "Singapore Airlines ", "Customer_name": "M Davies"}
