The lounge in London is really nice. We flew on the A340-600 which is quite old and is not lie flat, but its decent enough. The lounge in Doha is horrible, especially compared to the old one. Its huge, impersonal and it feels like most of the airport is in there with you rather than being a quiet sanctuary. More like a school canteen than a business lounge. The flight to Ahmedabad is on an A321 and is fine. Its not lie flat or anything but its a very short flight.", "air_title": "Qatar Airways ", "Customer_name": "P van Jaarsveldt"}
