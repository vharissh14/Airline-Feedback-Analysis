The outbound flight from BNE was excellent. The staff could not be faulted. The seats and the IFE were excellent. We took advantage of book the cook from Singapore and the food was of a very high standard and well presented. The only stumble on the SIN-FCO sector is the old style IFE. My wife slept comfortably on the lie down bed The return from FCO was good - excellent service and good meals but once again - old IFE. We had chosen book the cook for the sector SIN-BNE but it was a let down - overheated and not very palatable or well presented. The staff did the best they could but it was a let down after 3 great sectors.", "air_title": "Singapore Airlines ", "Customer_name": "Walker Christopher"}
