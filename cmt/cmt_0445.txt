Last year we arrived 20 minutes before departure at Don Muang airport in Bangkok (very difficult to reach during rush hour). There where several queues and we asked some Air Asia ground personnel if they could help. They helped us and about one minute before departure we entered the plain. Arriving in Phuket our luggage was also in good condition and well kept by the aircraft personnel. I think that Air Asia is worth the money.", "air_title": "AirAsia ", "Customer_name": "R Coumans"}
