Fantastic service, as expected of SQ Business Class. IFS switched effortlessly to dialect and Mandarin when speaking to my parents, who do not speak English. The crew were professional, attentive and friendly. Seats were excellent, better than the Asiana Business Class which I took 3 weeks prior. The noise-cancelling headsets given gave me painful ears after a while though. This was the first time I used their headsets as I used to carry my own - room for improvement on that. While everything else worked perfectly, the privacy screen was stuck and took a strapping male FA some effort to take out. Food was very good, except for dessert where the Chocolate Truffle Cake for dessert was disappointingly dry and hard. We enjoyed both the Japanese and the Western options. Food was served upon being airborne, which was about 11am, so it was rather early for lunch. When we asked for some fruits for snacks (or anything, really) at around 3pm, the FA said they did not have any food left and offered us mixed nuts instead. Perhaps SQ should stock up on snack items?", "air_title": "Singapore Airlines ", "Customer_name": "Lau Ni"}
