All flights departed and arrived on time. Aircraft was modern and clean A330, with nice interior. Seats were not the most comfortable and felt a bit cramped. IFE was very good, user friendly. The cabin crew are wonderful, very helpful, kind and courteous. Food was of high quality, however the continental breakfast was a let down. All kinds of amenities were available and snacks provided on request. I did enjoy my trip with Singapore Airlines, maybe a tad overrated. I feel other Asian airlines such as KE, CX, CI are just as good, but still one of the best airlines you can fly!", "air_title": "Singapore Airlines ", "Customer_name": "A Makiol"}
