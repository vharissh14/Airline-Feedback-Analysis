Very strange first sector. There seemed to be fewer cabin crew serving our side of the cabin, and the guy we encountered most seemed very flustered, almost as if it were his first day on the job. The printed menu card was substituted with a photocopied equivalent when our food order was taken and it featured a few changes, none of them for the better. They also quickly ran out of rose champagne and one of the white wines. The next sector to EDI was superb, particularly the attentive cabin crew.", "air_title": "Qatar Airways ", "Customer_name": "C Kay"}
