With stops either way in Dubai. Hadn't flown Emirates since 2005 and very mixed reviews but I had to book a trip due to a family illness in England, literally booked 4 days before flying and Emirates gave me a very good price. On all 4 sectors I flew A380s couldn't fault them, the planes were clean, staff were courteous, ICE was excellent and meals not too bad and above all the toilets were kept very clean, flew in the forward economy section on 3 sectors and it felt very cosy. Keep it up Emirates will certainly fly you back to Italy next year with my wife.", "air_title": "Emirates ", "Customer_name": "Taylor Frank"}
