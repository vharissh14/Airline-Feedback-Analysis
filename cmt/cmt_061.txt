The plane a B777-200ER had the new business class configuration (1-2-1). This new business class is comparable to the very best standards. The seat is comfortable in any position. The IFE is nice with a wide screen and a lot of selection. On these two flights the cabin crew was very professional and friendly too. The food was very good westbound, so-so eastbound. Wine selection just OK for a French airline. Compare to the current (and very poor) business class, what a change!", "air_title": "Air France ", "Customer_name": "Eric Martin"}
