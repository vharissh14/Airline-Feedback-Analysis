SYD-SIN on the old (and very full) 777-200. The entertainment system on this leg is awful, barely any good movies to watch, very limited. Food was fine. Arrived in Singapore early, gate to connecting flight just next door, too good to be true. They say if it's too good to be true, it probably is - the flight to Zurich was delayed 4 hours due to a hydraulic problem with the plane (oil leaking throughout the wing). Although this was extremely frustrating, the staff were extremely helpful, assisting people who were going to miss their next connecting flights etc. When we finally got on the flight to Zurich (an A380) the staff were great. Food pretty good and entertainment much better. Singapore Airlines always provide excellent service and Changi airport is very easy to navigate.", "air_title": "Singapore Airlines ", "Customer_name": "H Watson"}
