Seats / staff / service excellent. Catering, however for special diet (gluten free) was awful. Nicely presented but just dry chicken FOUR times over the 2 legs! GF is very easy diet to produce tasty meal. Just had a far better one on Qantas domestic flight in economy! Have flown all major airlines to Oz and this was the worst for me for food.", "air_title": "Qatar Airways ", "Customer_name": "B Little"}
