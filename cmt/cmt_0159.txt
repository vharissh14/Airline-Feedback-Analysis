Staff were very pleasant and smiling. The food was the best airplane meal I have had, it was delicious and there was plenty of it. Seats where fine and the entertainment system on all 4 flights was up to date. Your boarding cards gets you discounts on various attractions in Singapore, so keep them. Changi Airport is the best airport I have seen, so green and a lot to do and see if you have to wait a long time.", "air_title": "Singapore Airlines ", "Customer_name": "Dilleng Steffen"}
