The flights over were at Christmas so the leg to SIN was packed. Late departure made for a very tight connection at SIN. Attentive service, comfortable seat for a day flight and book the cook worked but the food was ok, not outstanding. SIN-ZRH on A380 was quite empty upstairs so very attentive service with the whole back part of the cabin to myself. Toilets seemed to be cleaned after every use although they're the smallest I've encountered in a business cabin. The seat was good but the mattress a bit thin and the weird need to put feet in a small box on one side isn't entirely comfortable. Honestly there are much more comfortable options. IFE wasn't as good as others but a decent selection of movies and TV shows available. I can't say I liked all the advertising on it though. Friendly, attentive staff, clean aircraft and ok food and entertainment but in my opinion, there are better options for far less money.", "air_title": "Singapore Airlines ", "Customer_name": "J Harris"}
