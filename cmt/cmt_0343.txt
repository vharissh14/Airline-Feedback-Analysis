This budget airline surprised me in almost every aspect I can think of. Ground and Cabin Crew were friendly, both outbound and inbound flight were on time, price was reasonable. Although its unfortunate that they are still stationed at the old manila domestic airport, I can say that it doesn't mean the other local airlines using the new airport terminal are better. I can even say that my experience with Air Asia was way more pleasant compared to the others.", "air_title": "AirAsia ", "Customer_name": "Landingin Mark"}
