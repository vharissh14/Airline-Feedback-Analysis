On the evening prior to our flight, we were notified by way of a very simple email that our flight had been canceled. No phone numbers were provided of personnel who could assist us with rescheduling, nor were we able to call the local customer service number as they close in TLV at 5pm and this was past 10. We Skype'd with customer service in the US and were told that we had been rebooked on El Al - which is great, but someone could have told us! Anyway, we flew out of TLV with El Al to connect in CDG to SFO and the flight was uneventful. Old, ugly plane with seats that have no support or leg room (I'm 5'10\", long legs) and a horrible entertainment system. The stewardesses tried, that has to be said, but their service was perfunctory at best. I think the main problem is that it honestly feels as though AF doesn't care about their customers, that they're a source of revenue and that their travel experience just simply doesn't matter to the company. I have other comments to make but they're about issues that I'm not allowed to discuss.", "air_title": "Air France ", "Customer_name": "Jo Silver"}
