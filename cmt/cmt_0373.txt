This was our first Business Class flight experience with Air Asia and it exceeded all our expectations. Because it is a No Frills Airline we were not expecting a full service. We made our meal selection at the time of booking. We were given a glass of orange juice on arrival, and the meals we had selected were delivered soon after take-off. These are normal economy fare but at the fare we paid we did not expect any different. Alcohol was available for payment. The seats however are as good as you would hope to find in any full service business class. Fully lie flat and with the full size pillow and duvet supplied we enjoyed a good sleep for almost the entire flight. Would I chose this again? Absolutely!", "air_title": "AirAsia ", "Customer_name": "Ross Blackmore"}
