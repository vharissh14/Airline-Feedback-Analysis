AKL-SIN-AMS-CPH-SIN-AKL. First two on 777-300ER and return on 777-200ER. As always fabulous and consistent service and quality all round. SQ is refitting their 777-200ER fleet with decent Business class seats similar to those fitted to the 300's and A380's but they still have 4 or 5 aircraft's not yet done. Unfortunately I got one sector with one of these and they are bad after you've experienced their newer product. If you are unlucky enough to get one of these you probably won't know until you board, see the seats and get that sinking feeling! Looking forward to them finishing the job as they appear to be using the old ones to NZ a lot!", "air_title": "Singapore Airlines ", "Customer_name": "C Jones"}
