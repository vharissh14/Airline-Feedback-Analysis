Stewardess were attentive and polite. Hot towel upon arrival. Food was excellent. Seats were comfortable. Good serving time and the drinks were great. Power sockets were found on the seats, great for my laptop! Something that I have not seen on my previous trip to Taiwan with the local airlines there.
