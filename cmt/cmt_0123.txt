I was very disappointed by the poor quality of the seat. They were from the old generation with a very small individual screen. The seat was very hard with a lack of legroom. The meal was good but could have been improved. The crew were nice. Regarding the inflight entertainment - good choice of movies but very poor choice of music.", "air_title": "Air France ", "Customer_name": "R Girard"}
