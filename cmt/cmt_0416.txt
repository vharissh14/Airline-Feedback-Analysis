This is by no means a budget carrier due to their increasing prices. They were the only carrier to offer a direct flight, less than two hours (avoiding BKK), but at a cost of almost \u00a3300 one way for two people. Thai, Bangkok and Nokair all stopped at Bangkok. Nothing given for free on board, no entertainment. You got to pay for luggage and I couldn't fathom out how not to pay for their insurance! Better and cheaper fares offered with main airline carriers. Although the flight was straightforward.", "air_title": "AirAsia ", "Customer_name": "James Choochot"}
