Customer Service standards also seem to be slipping. On arrival at the airport I was informed my flight was delayed 3 hours but wasn't told that an earlier flight was also delayed and I could have caught that one and still made an onward connection. The previous couple of flights also had delayed arrivals (up to 2 hours) and therefore incredibly rushed connections (with onward flight delayed to wait for connecting passengers). Hope they return to previous high standards soon.", "air_title": "Emirates ", "Customer_name": "S Brooking"}
