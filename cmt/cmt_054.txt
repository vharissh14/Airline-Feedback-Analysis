Good flights overall. I paid \u00a350 for an exit row seat one way at the time of booking, which I think was good value on a \u00a3500 return flight, and the configuration of 2-4-2 is good as it means only ever one person to climb over regardless of seat position. My baggage didn't make it to Rio, although the connection was tight and they were punctual with delivery in Rio the day after. Food onboard was pretty good although IFE left a bit to be desired - not all that much choice available. Overall, the experience was good and at around \u00a3490 at the cheaper end for Europe to Brazil - Paris CDG is a ridiculous airport to transfer through. It's a huge maze and you do security again despite having just done it in London 45 min before.", "air_title": "Air France ", "Customer_name": "H James"}
