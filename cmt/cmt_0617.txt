HAM-DXB on the B777, very modern aircraft, good seats. DXB-NBO on the A330, return B777, slightly older but good compared to several other airlines. Seats are good on all aircraft's, plenty of legroom. Inflight entertainment probably one of the best in the world, there is a big variety of Music, Movies, tv series, games etc on a big touchscreen. Food is good (both quality and quantity), and I really like Dubai airport, even though it is rather large. All flights on time. Really nothing to complain about, great value for money!", "air_title": "Emirates ", "Customer_name": "D Hector"}
