Comfortable enough flight on all legs, legroom good in economy and service typically robotic and boring. IFE excellent. No issue with inflight as they are definitely good. No recognition whatsoever for status despite my partner spending significant sums with this airline, but no surprises there as this is the usual procedure with Singapore Airlines these days. Lounge in Singapore not good. On a long haul flight such as this, there are no showering amenities. I realise for Business and First travellers this is available in SilverKris lounge but in KrisFlyer Gold not. The lounge is very basic, and as their hub being Changi, I had expected more. Food options were lacklustre and overall quite disappointing. The flight itself however couldn't fault and arrived feeling fairly refreshed at either end, but their lounges at all destinations where SQ operated are always fairly average. LHR, SIN, MEL all initially come to mind.", "air_title": "Singapore Airlines ", "Customer_name": "N Hodgson"}
