Very nice smooth flight. A printed menu, good food, a great entertainment system. The 777 is not the most spacious aircraft, but never mind, at least Singapore Airlines have the brains to stick to a 3x3x3 seating arrangement and do not push it to 3x4x3 like some others, such as Air New Zealand do. (In my opinion there should be some international law that forbids this practice because the cramped isle compromises safety.) The service and entertainment made up for the lack of space so I would still rate it as a 5 star experience.", "air_title": "Singapore Airlines ", "Customer_name": "H Thordarson"}
