Emirates offered the best price and connections to/from Australia and New Zealand. Really disappointing LGW to DXB service - staff were rude, had no personality and seemed rushed. Food was average and entertainment not much better. We left the flight in DXB more than willing to give them a second chance to impress on the longer DXB-BNE sector (14hrs on the A380) but more of the same. Staff were rude, unfriendly, seemed rushed to complete service, more concerned with doing their make-up (we were sat next to the galley) than much else. Really poor. We're flying back CHC-SYD-BKK-DXB-LGW and to say that we're looking forward to it would be misleading. Compared to other long-haul flights we've flown (Air NZ, Virgin Atlantic, Singapore, BA), Emirates are by far and away the worst - unless it seems you are lucky to be a Gold member, when they can't do enough for you.", "air_title": "Emirates ", "Customer_name": "T Marsden"}
