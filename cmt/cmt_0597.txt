Noticed that 25% of passengers received a drink before take off. Crew too busy to serve all of us. No drink service for the 2hr 27min. Each request met with \"it will be along shortly\". I realize that is why so many regular business travelers dashed to the bar before the seat belt signs were switched off. The meal was still cold, when I mentioned this I was told that \"it had been dealt with in accordance with instructions and we are very busy\". It is very obvious that Emirates do not carry enough crew on the A380 to serve everyone the same in the business section. Make sure that you are not at the back! The next leg of the journey on a smaller plane was far better. They just did not bring the luggage.", "air_title": "Emirates ", "Customer_name": "D Bent"}
