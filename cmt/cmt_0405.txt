Flight was on time with a couple minutes late. Both flight was close to full as it was holiday week in Cambodia. Once again, nothing much to complain or pride. Except, I noticed the quality of ground crew and flight attendant going downward. Unfriendly and very unapproachable. I know this is a low-fare airline, however given the price paid for, at least a smile or \"welcome aboard\" is shown to the customers.", "air_title": "AirAsia ", "Customer_name": "V Peang"}
