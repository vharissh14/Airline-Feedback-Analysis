We were advised at check-in that there had been a change of aircraft and our hearts sank when we boarded, it was an ancient 777, surprised that Singapore Airlines still uses these dinosaurs. I have never experienced such old, uncomfortable business class seats (you could select either seat recline or leg raise, not both at the same time). I am only 5 ft 4\" and I felt scrunched up. There was no storage around the seat area for personal belongings on this very old plane, really not good enough for a five star airline on a long haul route. No mattress over the seats as you get with Qantas and no amenities pack (only slippers and eye shade). The only saving grace were the crew, they were exemplary, fantastic in fact and the meals were fantastic. If only the aircraft matched the wonderful service on board.", "air_title": "Singapore Airlines ", "Customer_name": "J Murray"}
