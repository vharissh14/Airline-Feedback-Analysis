The seats are very comfortable in economy class, the legroom is pretty spacious for me. The lunch service with three options which I have not personally had before and both quantity and quality of meals are at the top level of service. The most important thing about the sector should be the cabin crew, they were very attentive. Overall, I have been very pleased with the quality given by Singapore Airlines and recommend the airline for long haul flights.", "air_title": "Singapore Airlines ", "Customer_name": "Alan Tang"}
