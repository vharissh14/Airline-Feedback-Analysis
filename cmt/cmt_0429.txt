We have flown on airlines throughout the world and have never been on a worse airline in 50 years of flying. Kuala Lumpur airport is awful. When you ask if there are meals provided they say \"yes\", but don't tell you that you are required to pay extra. If you have cashed in your money because you are flying into another country, you are out of luck. We were 6 hours without a coffee, water, or tea. When we asked for a complimentary coffee, the flight attendant said, \"No, we are a low cost airline\". They nickel and dime you all the way. When you check in they ask if you would like to check your bag. Then hit you with a $30 charge! However, they let all kinds of over-sized bags on the plane, so getting to your seat is total chaos. Loading the plane is a joke. It is basically a stampede to the plane out on the tarmac, it is a total free for all on the tarmac.", "air_title": "AirAsia ", "Customer_name": "Stephen\u00a0Britton"}
