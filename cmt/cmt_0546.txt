The attendants were lovely and the food wasn't bad (it has certainly improved since my first Qatar flight). However, the movie selection was dreadful as usual. I do not understand why they can't have a good selection of recent releases as all the general movies they show have been seen 100 times! The flight from Doha to Paris was great - comfortable and I love the new Doha airport. Despite the IFE I would still travel to Paris from Perth on Qatar because they have really great take off and landing times both ways.", "air_title": "Qatar Airways ", "Customer_name": "Cuneo Devon"}
