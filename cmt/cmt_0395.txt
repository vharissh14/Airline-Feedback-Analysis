Total cost was 927MYR (\u00a3171 or just 329 each). We were astounded at the high quality of the flight, the cleanliness of the aircraft and the friendliness and professionalism of the crew. Having paid a very low price (to us in England) we were expecting a below-Ryanair experience but this was anything but. Proper seats, seat back pockets, a wide range of snacks- this was far higher standard than Finnair offered on their Manchester-Helsinki flights. Will not hesitate to use AirAsia again.", "air_title": "AirAsia ", "Customer_name": "Mike Whitehouse"}
