I enjoyed my first flight very nice crew with a lot of choices of beverages. Even different types of wine were proposed. However my flight back was disappointing. Crew much less polite, beverages were only hot chocolate and coffee. It was an early flight but they could have still offered orange or apple juice for example. Regarding the seat comfort, nothing to say, they were quite comfortable for a medium-haul flight.", "air_title": "Air France ", "Customer_name": "R Girard"}
