I found that the departure time is nice but the return time is far too early in the morning so my travel agent advised me to use SIA sister company, Silk Air for the return. Expecting something special as I'm paying more money, I didn't find anything special except the extra amenities. The so called Singapore Ladies/stewardess that are heavily advertised are nothing special. Please prepare to be disappointed.", "air_title": "Singapore Airlines ", "Customer_name": "Gonzales Pedro"}
