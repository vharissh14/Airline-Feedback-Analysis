We were booked onto the 6.25am flight, for which we arrived at BHX two hours prior to departure only to find that our flight was actually being handled by FlyBe. After over an hour in the check-in queue we heard a message that there was a computer error, we were devastated when our flight was instructed to take off without us and approximately 60 other passengers, as we couldn't be checked in at this time. We were travelling with two young children and a baby and were disgusted at the lack of organisation by the airline in the hours that followed. We were not spoken to by any members of staff about what to do next but told to go and have breakfast with our \u00a35 food vouchers, what can \u00a3 \u00a35 buy you in an airport? I refused to leave the check-in desk until I had details about our re-booked flights and after five hours of sitting on the airport floor complaining, I finally managed to get a member of staff to book us on to the next flight to Lyon where there would be a connecting flight to Paris. By the time we landed at Paris CDG we had been travelling for fourteen hours and the children were distressed, hungry and tired. To then be told that this incompetent airline had lost one of our suitcases and my pushchair, was the final straw.", "air_title": "Air France ", "Customer_name": "S J Bird"}
