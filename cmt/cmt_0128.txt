Have had difficulties pre-selecting a seat or checking-in online. Just like the time before or the time before that. CDG-Rio leg on upper deck of 747 in AF seatplus (ordinarily payable but free for FB elite, which is my case). Check-in agent in AMS wasn't able to put me on those seats. At CDG, a very friendly and helpful agent did. Cabin half empty, seats quite good for economy, and service friendly and professional despite the late departure hour. BUE to CDG on 777. Seats cramped and seat configuration defies logic. Seats are so arranged that for window passengers, there is nothing but the window itself to lean against and try to sleep. Easily one of the worst long haul economy propositions I've come across. Departure on time and early arrival. Food inedible.", "air_title": "Air France ", "Customer_name": "D Cassius"}
