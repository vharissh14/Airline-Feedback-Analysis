The seats on A330 were spacious and comfortable, but the table surface is slippery and your meal tray will slide off if you don't hold onto it. This can be prevented by the use of a tablecloth as found in other airlines' business class. The previous passenger's socks were still in the footwell, so cabin grooming could use some work. The meal was good, but drinks service was infrequent. All in all, this experience was comparable to a domestic business class on a US carrier - certainly far short of the Singapore Airlines I was expecting.", "air_title": "Singapore Airlines ", "Customer_name": "D Rose"}
