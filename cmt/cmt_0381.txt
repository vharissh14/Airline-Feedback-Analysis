Our family of 8 flew from Johor Bahru - KL, so a quick flight. Check-in was smooth, however, we arrived early and it was quite sometime before the check-in counter opened. The waiting area at Johor Bahru is just adequate. However, the flight itself was smooth and efficient, getting us to KL on time. As it was such a quick flight there was no time for inflight entertainment or food & beverages. I would highly recommend AirAsia. Value for money was excellent.", "air_title": "AirAsia ", "Customer_name": "Rebecca Mason"}
