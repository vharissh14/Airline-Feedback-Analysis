BUD-CDG on A321. Uneventful flight, however, seating on board AFs A321 fleet is not too comfortable. Pitch and width quite tight. Connection in CDG (late evening) a breeze - hardly any other passengers at passport control, did not have to go through security again. CDG-HKG an A380. Upper deck economy seating feels much more private - and the boarding process is usually quicker, as you get to join a separate line for upper deck (only 8 rows). Onboard service good, nice meals for ecoonomy (and even a hot breakfast). bars are set up on both decks with drinks and snacks (ice cream is a nice touch). Seats on AF's A380 are quite spacious - more width than Emirates and ample pitch. Easily one of the best longhaul economy experiences. The IFE is usable, but not top- notch (anymore) - the responsiveness of the screen is annoying. The selection of movies and TV shows is not very large, but okay. All in all, a nice experience at a very competitive price.", "air_title": "Air France ", "Customer_name": "S Abe"}
