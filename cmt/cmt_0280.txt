The flight was ok but the service was amazing! The food was good, the seat was good. It was a red-eye flight that was 7hrs and only 1:30hrs of sleep - it took 2:30hrs for dinner and 2hrs for breakfast. I would recommend that Singapore Airlines should do short meal services for red-eye flights.", "air_title": "Singapore Airlines ", "Customer_name": "Oscar Nyholm"}
