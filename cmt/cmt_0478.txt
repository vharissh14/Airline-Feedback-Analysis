BCN-DOH first leg was neither a good nor bad surprise: quite smooth check-in thanks to my Sapphire OneWorld status, enjoyable VIP Lounge at BCN airport (although not well-provided at all about food), respected Priority Boarding, no delays. Equipment was a newly-configured Airbus A330-200, I was seated in an emergency exit so I had extra legroom. Food average, nice selection of beverages. Things became complicated when I collapsed on the 5th hour of the flight (hyper arterial pressure) and was put within hands of cabin crew. QR does not know how to manage a simple issue whatsoever: disembarked at DOH all the way to airport clinic, then sent to Hamad hospital for further examinations. The nightmare took 19 hours. Had to fly back to DXB on the following day. Had to spend overnight at Oryx Lounge.", "air_title": "Qatar Airways ", "Customer_name": "Pierre-Jean Trebuchet"}
