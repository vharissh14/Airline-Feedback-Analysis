Flights were seriously delayed both ways without giving passengers due prior notification. On the outbound leg in Singapore we sat in the plane for about 2 hours before we could take off. On-board service was so-so, and the food was virtually inedible. No wonder everyone seemed to have ordered a special meal.", "air_title": "Singapore Airlines ", "Customer_name": "Peter Borschberg"}
