The aircraft from Dallas was A380 which cannot be doubted on its comfort. I requested an exit row seat and got it. Food was very good and tasty from Dallas to Dubai. However, cabin crew didn't respond for long on 2 occasions I called through my seat button. Service from Dubai to Mumbai was okayish, nothing great to talk about. Old Boeing 777-300 which was stinking. I think Emirates doesn't focus properly on one of its major markets India with respect to quality and service. Overall, I would give 3.5 stars to Emirates. 4 for DFW-DXB leg and 3 for DXB-BOM leg. I got value for money since I got a very low fare.", "air_title": "Emirates ", "Customer_name": "Haider Hazrat"}
