SUB-CGK. Overall the trip was good. The cabin crews were polite. But the staff service wasn't very good, when I entered the boarding gate, the staff hasn't placed the airport tax thing behind the boarding pass although we had paid to her. Because of that we should wait for minutes before boarding the aircraft.", "air_title": "AirAsia ", "Customer_name": "William Lay"}
