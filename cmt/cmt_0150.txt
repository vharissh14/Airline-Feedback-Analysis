Two excellent 12 hours flights, good seat comfort, staff service superior, they walk through cabin with juice and water three times per hour, staff provide a good atmosphere and spirit in cabin, and at all times kept toilets clean. IFE screens needs update, too small and inferior image quality. On flight back to CPH captain made very thorough explanation prior to entering severe turbulence, this info made many passengers feel better during the one hour rough ride. Have flown SIA regularly for 35 years, still my absolute favorite.", "air_title": "Singapore Airlines ", "Customer_name": "M Sommerville"}
