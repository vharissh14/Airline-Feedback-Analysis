Return was on D223 Sydney to KL on 7/10 then same date KL to Phuket on AK222. I booked well in advance for a trip to Sydney via Kuala Lumpur and am a frequent flyer with Aisr Asia so am aware of the restrictions for the excellent price and service which is provided. I would have liked to have been informed that there was no Business Class Lounge at Kuala Lumpur airport and also it would have helped if they had given us some idea of the great distance between Gates. I cannot fault their service at the desks, through the Gates and on the aircraft. Business Class is extremely comfortable and with the exception of the food and beverage arrangement which I was aware of, very good.", "air_title": "AirAsia ", "Customer_name": "Jacqueline Perry"}
