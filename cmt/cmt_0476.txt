The lounge in Ahmedabad is very funny. All the airlines use it but it is more of a cupboard behind a restaurant. The flight to Doha is on an A321 and is fine. Its not lie flat or anything but its a very short flight. On the return leg we flew on the new A380 from Doha to London. That was a horrible experience and I will avoid this aircraft like the plague. The service is terrible, you have to wait ages for anyone to attend to you. I think its because there are too many people. Stick with the 777 if you can. The IFE keeps hanging or the controls fail. I gave up after the 3rd attempt and went and sat in the bar with my wife, which is quite pleasant.", "air_title": "Qatar Airways ", "Customer_name": "P van Jaarsveldt"}
