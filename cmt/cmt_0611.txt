A380 leg was comfortable, food OK, crew efficient. 777-300, Dubai to Dhaka - plane full, cabin crew unenthusiastic - had to wait over 90 mins for food and a drink, a drink should at least be served earlier if the wait for service is so long. Return leg Dhaka to Dubai, 777-300ER, plane again full. Cabin crew better and more organised, but food was extremely disappointing-so called breakfast was a sloppy curry, alternative was fish. Seats on 777 are cramped and narrow. Dubai to London Heathrow A380-nice new plane, seats more comfortable and cabin crew pleasant, organised and efficient. Cabin crews seem very variable, too many need to learn to smile.", "air_title": "Emirates ", "Customer_name": "Taylor David"}
