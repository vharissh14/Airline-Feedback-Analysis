Outbound flight good, friendly check in assistant who allocated me an emergency exit seat with extra leg room because of my disability. Worst problem was the 7 hour wait in Doha, which we were aware of. However, on the return flight, unfriendly and unwilling to assist at check in, even though I am registered on their site as disabled and therefore not able to check in online, no assistance given. We were given our tickets and, thankfully, I checked our connection from Doha to Manchester and it had been changed and we were not informed. This resulted in a six hour wait in Doha instead of an hour and half. No assistance given on either leg of journey to allocate me extra legroom and, only when we were about to board the flight from Doha to Manchester, we then discovered we were in separate rows but I had been allocated a middle seat which with my disability makes it worse. We managed to change seats on the airplane thanks to a helpful fellow traveler but with no assistance from the airline crew. Also found the seats very uncomfortable and had a sore back for days after returning home. Never again!", "air_title": "Qatar Airways ", "Customer_name": "A Coldrey"}
