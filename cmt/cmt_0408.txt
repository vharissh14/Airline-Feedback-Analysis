At check in at Changi, this was confirmed and my dad was well taken care of right up till he was seated. Cabin crew professional, organised and polite. Seat comfort was ok, legroom is tight but that was expected. Departure and arrival were both almost 40 mins late. Wheelchair was waiting after deplaning via stairs at Bali. (I did wonder how we would have managed getting my dad down had he not been able to use the stairs..) Fortunately he did and he was met by a friendly ground staff who took him all the way through. Bags were out quickly. Return from bali was equally efficiently handled. No problems with the wheel chair request and early boarding. All in all very impressed with Air Asia's professionalism and well run operation.", "air_title": "AirAsia ", "Customer_name": "S Klass"}
