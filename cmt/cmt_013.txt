I'll never understand airline pricing policies: this flight was cheaper than flying from Paris to Glasgow! The flight was not crowded so I had a whole row of seats to myself and was thus able to put my feet up which was an unexpected luxury when flying in economy (hence the five stars for seat comfort and value for money). I fly very frequently and hadn't flown with Air France on a long-haul flight for many years and was very pleasantly surprised by the food. It was delicious and a real cut above all the meals I've eaten aboard Emirates, Qatar, Aeroflot, Singapore, China Eastern etc. over the past few years. The cabin crew were charming, friendly (mostly fairly mature men which as a woman I find a pleasant change from the often surly and very young women aboard many of the other airlines) and efficient. Given the choice another time I'd fly with this airline again.", "air_title": "Air France ", "Customer_name": "C Mackenzie"}
