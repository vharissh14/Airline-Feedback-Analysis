I first used them two years ago when I went UK - Auckland return and at that time I could not fault them in anyway, this time my experience was different. The food was awful, I'm not a person that's fussy about food but every meal was awful. The staff as always were great but you have to ask for everything now that's not standard such as a beer! Don't get me wrong they will get you one but you have to ask, before they would ask you. The pillows were dirty, god knows with what but you wouldn't put your head on one. I cant put my finger on it but the planes all four were tired. Maybe just a case that they are cutting back the same as everyone else but to me there's no excuse for such poor meals. 3 of us travelled and all of us thought the same.", "air_title": "Singapore Airlines ", "Customer_name": "D Fell"}
