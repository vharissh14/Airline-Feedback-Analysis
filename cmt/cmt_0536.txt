Awesome experience. Excellent seats on B-777 ER/LR, superb food (presented first class style - not a tray in sight), awesome lounge in Doha and service from the crew - best I have experienced (and I fly over 150K miles/year with One World). In fact, I was on Cathay First a couple weeks prior from LAX-HKG-LAX and this QR service was as good or better (certainly better food on QR business than CX First). Great seat comfort with mattress toppers and duvets and seat massage function, Excellent wines (presented restaurant style) and Champagnes - flawless. My wife and 2 kids felt the same way.", "air_title": "Qatar Airways ", "Customer_name": "D Thakkar"}
