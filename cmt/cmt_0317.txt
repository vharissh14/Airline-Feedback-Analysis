We used both the 777, and airbus 380. What an experience! A lovely huge flat bed, an excellent choice of food and wines, and amazing service. How they managed to provide such excellent food 32,000 feet up was mind boggling! The stewards and stewardesses, were so helpful and friendly, nothing was too much trouble. They may charge more than some other airlines, but they are well worth the money. They will always be my airline of choice!", "air_title": "Singapore Airlines ", "Customer_name": "Hilary Simm"}
