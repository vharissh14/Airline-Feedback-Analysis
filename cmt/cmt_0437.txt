Pre flight customer service was a nightmare. My flight was delayed before my trip, I was sent an SMS to be advised of this. I was offered an earlier flight, that wasn't going to work because I was travelling from Adelaide at that time. There were no changes made and they acknowledged there was no change. When I arrived in KL to check in, they inform me my flight was changed to the earlier flight. There was a lot of hassle and waiting but I was provided with my boarding pass. Flight was good, aircraft could do with some updating, but the flight was half empty which meant flat bed. Check in gave me a hot seat without paying for it. As soon as seat belt sign was off I went to sleep, staff left me alone and it was all good. Cant comment on food or how the service was, but as far as I am concerned in the air I got what I wanted. The selection of food is quite bland, I would prefer to just take my food on board. For the price it was not bad. When it comes to Staff service I have based it on the pre customer service as that's where I experienced most of the customer service.", "air_title": "AirAsia ", "Customer_name": "M Lokan"}
