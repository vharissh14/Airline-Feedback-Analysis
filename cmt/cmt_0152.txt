I am constantly pointing out to the flight crew, out of every 4 flights I take on SIA, I will experience problems with the entertainment system on at least 3. If not complete breakdown, it is usually a problem with \u00e2stuttering (picture freezes and then catches up but cutting out parts of the film in the process) and/or the sound disappearing half way through a film. My family members share my experience. Consequently, the problem is systemic and chronic. The fact that SIA does nothing to improve this demonstrates not only a clear lack of commitment to delivering a seamless, enjoyable passenger experience but also a lack of consideration for the flight crew who have to spend so much time unnecessarily dealing with passengers complaints. By the way, system reboots are a very frustrating and annoying thing for passengers to put up with. But, this seems to be the cheap route they have chosen, rather than fixing what is patently broken.", "air_title": "Singapore Airlines ", "Customer_name": "J Lee"}
