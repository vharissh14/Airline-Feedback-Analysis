All 4 legs were on-time or even early! Apart from the Doha/Dubai leg, the other flights were only half full so people could spread out and have the centre 4 seats to sleep. However, I really would not say it is a five star service! The meals were OK, nothing special and the portions not that large. The inflight entertainment was very good, in my opinion. No amenity kits with socks or eyeshades for a 6 hr flight! On all 4 legs I found the crews very well groomed, professional but not exactly warm and friendly.", "air_title": "Qatar Airways ", "Customer_name": "A Saraiva"}
