Arriving at the counter at 1.15pm I asked the counter if there was a delay in our flight, I was told that there was no such delay for our flight and that our boarding time was at 2.30pm. 2.30pm came and went and there was no announcement made regarding our flight. There was no one at the AirAsia departure lounge counter, so I went to the check in counter and asked staff what our flight status was. I was then informed that there would be announcements. 3.00pm - no announcements. 3.49pm, still no announcements. 4.17pm, no announcement. 4.28pm, an announcement that our flight will be delayed 1 hour. 5.35pm, an announcement that the plane will not arrive until 6.05pm. 6.08pm, arrival of the plane. 6.35pm, boarding. 7.00pm on the flight I asked the flight attendant for my pre purchased comfort kit and was informed that they did not have any on the flight. As you can imagine after spending over 3hours waiting for the flight and being told that my comfort kit was not available I was mighty ticked. I know that there are circumstances that flight will be delayed and I understand that, but the lack of communication given to customers was poor. I had heard such good things regarding AirAsia, but after this and the cancelation of our Clark to Kalibo flight on the 14th of November 2013, I will be very hesitant and wary of using AirAsia again.", "air_title": "AirAsia ", "Customer_name": "A Bradley"}
