Check-in and boarding quick. Aircraft on all flights equipped with PTVs and a great variety of entertainment features, good food, unlimited drinks including champagne, whisky and cognac. Staff very nice and helpful, composed of staff from around the globe speaking very good English. DOH-BKK-DOH onboard brand new A380 - the most comfortable flight I've flown. Plenty of legroom, very wide PTVs and comfy seats. Now it's hard to change QR for anything else.", "air_title": "Qatar Airways ", "Customer_name": "M Osiecki"}
