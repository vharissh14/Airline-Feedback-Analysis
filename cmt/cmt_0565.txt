MNL-DBX-AMM and CAI-DBX-MNL on the way back. The B777-300 ER is a nice plane, with departure at 12.20 am. With all the time spent in the airport and the lousy lounges at Manila airport (not airline's fault), one gets to the flight starving. Just to find out they have \"Light Bites Service\". All options below business class standards. Tiny portion leaves you starving for the rest of the flight until breakfast comes. No service in between. This service takes more than two hours to be completed, when people want to go to sleep as soon as possible. Then, the connection to Amman, was far worse. A330 plane is really bad, when the passenger in front of you fully reclines, you end up with his head on your lap. When things couldn't get worse, they did on the way back. Ground staff at Cairo are as bad as the airport itself. No priority boarding, long faces, a true mess. Fortunately, I was served dinner as it was dinner time. B777-200 also a very bad aircraft. My ICE screen got stuck when the guy in front of me reclined fully. Crew did nothing. Then, another red-eye to Manila, more \"Light Bites\" service, crew took three hours in offering the duvet for the hard seats (by then, they already woke me up). These flights require super-fast bed service, not three hours after. An really, can't you afford a true meal? Really disappointed.", "air_title": "Emirates ", "Customer_name": "Oscar Medina"}
