DOH-HKG operated by CX, so this review refers only to the MAN-DOH sectors. Outbound flight in a modernised A330 with a much smaller IFE box under the seat (makes a big difference to leg room), return flight in an older A330 with the much-larger IFE box and the older-style IFE interface. Leg room not an issue as both flights were half-empty, so I had the whole row to myself. Seats on both sectors were very uncomfortable: I always found them comfortable before, and the seats look quite new, so I suspect that cheaper/uncomfortable seats are now being installed. Cost-cutting and deteriorating standards are now evident elsewhere: tray tables not properly cleaned, less food than on previous flights (and worse quality), poorly maintained toilet facilities, and very unhappy-looking FAs on both flights. Online booking page kept returning server errors - I tried to make changes to my schedule on several occasions, back home as well as in Hong Kong, with similar errors noted in both countries. I'm hoping that all this was just a one-off, or perhaps QR's previously flawless service has led me to expect too much. But, for the first time, I didn't enjoy the flights that much at all. It won't stop me from booking with them again, but if this situation continues, I will definitely consider switching to another carrier for my flights to east Asia. However, both flights were early, and the fares were excellent value, even after paying for a change of flights.", "air_title": "Qatar Airways ", "Customer_name": "Robert Szocik"}
