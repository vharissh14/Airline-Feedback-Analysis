The flight itself was OK but nothing great - our meal on a 2.5 hour flight was a plastic-wrapped sandwich (albeit with tasty fresh bread) and no alcohol served - service was friendly and helpful was my first flight with AF and probably the last.", "air_title": "Air France ", "Customer_name": "N Miller"}
