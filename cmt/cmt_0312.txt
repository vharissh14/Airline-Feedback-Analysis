After having to endure a flight from Copenhagen to Bangkok with SAS Scandinavian Airlines, the Singapore flight was like ascending from hell to heaven. The contrast could not have been greater. Wonderful service, great food and excellent entertainment. Singapore Airlines really care about their customers and it shows. Definitely worth every penny and highly recommended.", "air_title": "Singapore Airlines ", "Customer_name": "H Thordarson"}
