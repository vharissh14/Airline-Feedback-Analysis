Check-in was quick and the staff are very friendly. The inflight entertainment was wonderful as it is been updated not long ago there a lot of new movies. The business class seats were great - big and comfortable. I order the book the cook - really good although an average portion. I will definitely fly with Singapore Airlines in the future.", "air_title": "Singapore Airlines ", "Customer_name": "Jerome Chia"}
