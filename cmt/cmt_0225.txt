Easy breezy departing flight from CGK-SIN, check-in was quick and professional (apart from CGK airport condition with their on-going development). Arrived in SIN, surprised with a 20$ gift voucher to spend in Changi (SQ flights only). The next flight from SIN-CDG on 'THE' A380 (appropriately decorated with some mistletoe) was nothing but sheer pleasure. Although their seats are rock-hard, the legroom is all that I could ask from a cattle class (I am 184cm tall, that is a smidge over 6 feet). The IFE was good, even though it is a little bit outdated, it was still decent. The food? Inappropriately good! You should try the infamous Singapore Sling, too! The service was well-mannered, well- presented and well-trained cabin crews. The same goes with the return leg.", "air_title": "Singapore Airlines ", "Customer_name": "Brian Adam Pratama"}
