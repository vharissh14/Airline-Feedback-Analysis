Staff usually very friendly and accommodating but this last trip (Sydney/KUL/CNX) staff were a bit on the reserved side. This is unusual even with the short flights I have taken with Air Asia as well as some other business class flights. My rating for inflight entertainment was 3 out of 5 because one needs to purchase the entertainment separately and I did not use it as I was travelling overnight. Generally and for the most part, I would recommend flying Air Asia.", "air_title": "AirAsia ", "Customer_name": "Gary Ross"}
