A great service overall for this short flight, with an onboard snack which consisted of a selection of sandwiches and drinks. Crew were very friendly and seats were comfortable with good legroom in the economy section. There was a 20 minute delay on the return flight, caused by a problem with the airport buses, however it was an early morning flight, so the pilot said he was able to take 'shortcuts'. This worked and we landed in Dublin on time, despite the delay. Overall, for the service provided on such a short flight, it is hard to rate the airline down. Flights arrived on time, were comfortable, and had friendly staff. I would easily fly with Air France again.", "air_title": "Air France ", "Customer_name": "S Smyth"}
