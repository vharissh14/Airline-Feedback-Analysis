Both flights very poor service offered by staff if you could find them! ICN-SIN did not see flight attendants for a full hour after take off, no offer of any drinks before take off or after. Poor selection of lunch offered - Braised beef with lentils! Staff hid behind curtain no offer of refills during a 5 hour flight. SIN-BNE - FA's were rude, midnight flight there was no offer of any snacks during 8 hour flight and made to feel I was an inconvenience when asking for a drink. Breakfast meal (received 6 hours into flight) was rubbish. Have flown Economy with Singapore and it was fine. I thought flying Business Class was going to be an amazing experience -it was just terrible. Rude staff and poor service. Will never fly with them again as it was such a waste (of a lot) of money!", "air_title": "Singapore Airlines ", "Customer_name": "K Marshall"}
