Outward trip pretty ordinary, but no significant complaints. Thought it took a master stroke of organisation by Air France to seat myself and wife (pensioners) in 8A and B and to pre-board a severely disabled gentleman in 8C who was completely unable physically to move to allow us access to our seats. No complaint to him, he was great, but climbing into our seats, and out at CDG we did wonder how we were expected to cope. Overall a very basic experience.", "air_title": "Air France ", "Customer_name": "David Beggs"}
