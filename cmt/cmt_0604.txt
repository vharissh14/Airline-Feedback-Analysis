Outbound on Jan 31 and inbound on Feb 19. Inflight service is still hit and miss. Some staff in this route are either too tired or simply not that friendly as opposed to Emirates staff on short haul flights are extremely friendly. Good points: the Emirates lounge in LAX has just opened and I had the opportunity to try it. The lounge is the highlight of the flight. Food there is really gourmet quality. Just to prove the point, Emirates does not change the menu on this flight. Seriously this is really getting tiring for frequent travelers on the route. Will try Etihad or Turkish on my next trip to LAX.", "air_title": "Emirates ", "Customer_name": "Martin Hiu"}
