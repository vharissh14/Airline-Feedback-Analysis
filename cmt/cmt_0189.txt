I flew from Tokyo NRT to Los Angeles on their A380. Flight left on time, boarding was smooth and excellent service on board. Flight attendant extremely friendly and approachable, great food and drinks (being served wine on a glass and not on a plastic cup in economy was amazing) and wonderful entertainment (they even had Italian series in it). My only critique would be more leg room. Would surely recommend them to others and look forward to flying SA again.", "air_title": "Singapore Airlines ", "Customer_name": "M Riccardo"}
