Flight QZ7532. Every single time I flew AA the flight was delayed. They usually use a random excuse like \"delay due to the late arrival of the aircraft\". This time, 15 min before boarding I asked if the flight was on time. I was extremely surprised to hear that, yes, the flight was on time. 10 min before departure I enquired again as I couldn't see the airplane at the gate. Only then I was told that the flight was 2 hours delayed. As a pilot myself I know that staying on schedule is not always easy, but being late by that much, without having the ground staff to inform the passengers on PA, I thought that was extremely bad. They can't care less about their passengers.", "air_title": "AirAsia ", "Customer_name": "Damien Simon Labric"}
