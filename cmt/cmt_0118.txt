Return flight from Paris to Montreal by Air France last month. Both flights were just very good. Excellent service, tasty food, friendly staff and decent comfort. The service of Air France is really significantly better In comparison with competitors on this route like Air Canada and Air Transat. I will recommend this route of Air France to everyone who wants basic comfort during the travel.", "air_title": "Air France ", "Customer_name": "M Tushishvili"}
