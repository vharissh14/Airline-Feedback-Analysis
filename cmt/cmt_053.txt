Check in at JFK - friendly staff but boarding announcements not clear and confusing (A380). Premium Economy bought at airport - although comfortable I find the price is not truly value for money. Food and staff, good to excellent. Hassle free transfer at CDG including entering Schengen and additional security check.", "air_title": "Air France ", "Customer_name": "Vanblijdesteijn Ido"}
