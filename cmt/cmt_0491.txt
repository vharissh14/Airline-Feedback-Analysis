First leg to Doha on A330-200, not fully booked, I had aisle seat, plenty of room for my legs (I'm six foot). My entertainment system froze halfway through the film I was watching, so I ended up watching the screen on the next (empty) seat. Shiny screens so your reflection dominates a lot of what you watch. Food reasonable, service seemed a little slow, but overall a good first leg of the trip. There's only a 45 minute layover in Doha, but they are well geared up for this and no trouble with missing luggage, despite the gates being at opposite ends of the airport. Second leg to Melbourne on a 777-300ER, almost full, seats nowhere near as comfortable, far less leg room. Better entertainment system than the Airbus, matt screen so no reflection problems. Food probably slightly better but again, seems to be a slow process. Overall however I arrived in Melbourne feeling fit and refreshed, and would definitely take the same route again. Here's hoping for Airbus on the return journey.", "air_title": "Qatar Airways ", "Customer_name": "C Aiken"}
