It was my first time on the Singapore Airlines Airbus A380 in upper deck economy. Boarding was quick and efficient for both sectors, having it about 40 minutes before departure and with boarding queues ending quickly. Legroom was excellent (I am 170cm tall). Food on the Beijing sector was delicious, however, it was not served hot thus making it a little disappointing. Service was great as the crew smiled gracefully during meal service. However, a crew forgot to refill my orange juice (She did not have enough orange juice, so she told me she was going to get some for me but did not come). The entertainment was spectacular, with tons of movies and music. However, the movie tends to lag when viewed. So I settled down to listening to music instead. The seats are comfortable, but the pillow is too big so I feel they should make it smaller thus having it to use lesser space. The return sector was much better. The crew were more friendly and efficient compared to the Beijing sector. My dad's luggage had some issues so he told me to board the plane first. As I boarded the plane, the steward welcomed me warmly and kindly guided me to my seat, also helping me to find an available container to store mine and my father's large carry on. Food was much better on the return sector on the flight as it was served much warmer. I had a great experience with Singapore Airlines and I would recommend it anytime.", "air_title": "Singapore Airlines ", "Customer_name": "Phang Jun Xian"}
