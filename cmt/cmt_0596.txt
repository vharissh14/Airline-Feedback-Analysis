From MAA, 1/19/2015. I have been flying out from Dallas/Houston to couple of cities in India. Over the years Emirates have squeezed economy (or cattle class) as much as possible. Sometimes the behavior of the crew is surprising. Food is good however, the overall service is okay only. Given that Qatar and Etihad now flies out of Dallas, I will avoid Emirates in future.", "air_title": "Emirates ", "Customer_name": "Jai Muthu"}
