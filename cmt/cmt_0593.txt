From Birmingham on time, taxied to runway then had to return for an hour delay due to immigration, once taken off cabin service was good, the ICE entertainment system was not as good as it should be, once nearing Dubai we were told we were in a holding pattern due to sand storm, all connecting flights would be held, once landed after an hour circling, rapidly made our way to departure gate as notice boards stated final call. Got to the gate and plane had already gone. We made our way to transfer desk where nobody would offer an explanation as to why we couldn't land but connecting flight could take off, we were given a new flight EK 372, a delay of 6 hours, boarded on time, but then told we couldn't take off due to sandstorm, sat on plane for 3 hours before moving, yet planes all around us were taking off, finally landed in Bangkok 11 hours late, the only thing that helped me from going mad were the excellent cabin staff. Must also make a mention of excellent Chauffeur service. Emirates wants to be worlds best airline, not even best in Middle East. Will go back to Qatar for next flight.", "air_title": "Emirates ", "Customer_name": "K Wright"}
