Fantastic airline in all classes. Except for \u0093First\u0094 within middle East which is not \u0093real\u0094 First on a A320 as the seats are only typical old style bz/class seats. But as for the A380 the bz class gives a sublime experience almost to perfection. The bar onboard offers intelligently other brands of drinks as those on the menu card served while seated. I like the herring bone seat layout and found the trip cozy and staff caring. Ate at demand. Sophisticated drink lists with many expensive items offered like several wines one normally does not access easily. As usual poor on beer options. Only small portions of food offered as compared to earlier business class experiences with QR. Staff alert and professional and truly caring. A great experience. All flights on time, except one which caused a missing connection, however, QR instantly rebooked to my satisfaction and eventually I arrived on time to final destinations. They have a tendency to close servicing passengers on board far too early before landing (approx. 40 minutes), which is disappointing and unnecessary annoying.", "air_title": "Qatar Airways ", "Customer_name": "Anders Pedersen"}
