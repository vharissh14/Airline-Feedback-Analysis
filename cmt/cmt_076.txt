The crew was also exceptionally friendly, so that the overall experience was quite pleasant. If the seats get replaced to flat beds, then there will be very little to complain. The only thing that could may be improved is the selection of new movies.", "air_title": "Air France ", "Customer_name": "Karim Lanakarany"}
