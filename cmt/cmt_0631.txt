Emirates will always score points when I travel on their A380s and 77Ws. The IFE is brilliant and the food and beverage service is excellent for an economy class product. This flight was let down a little by the crew. They clearly did not get on well with one another and, for some, this carried over to their dealings with passengers. The PA announcements also seemed overdone with little thought to the timing of some, especially when being delivered in three languages. I found the boarding process interesting. Row numbers were called in increments of 5, logically starting from the back. There appeared to be an insistence that the entire gate area was scoured for every last passenger within the designated rows before the next 5 rows were called. I have never seen a 777 boarded so slowly, resulting in a 20 minute delay. It looked like the \"rules\" were getting in the way of reasonableness and that overly technical atmosphere summed up the flight. This flight was QF- ticketed and my outbound journey was with QF. I rated them the same overall, but for different reasons. Emirates has the hard product in its grasp, but I preferred the QF flight for its reassuring professionalism.", "air_title": "Emirates ", "Customer_name": "A Huggett"}
