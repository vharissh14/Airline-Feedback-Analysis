This airline is great value for money and perfect for getting you from point A to B for a fraction of the cost. Inflight entertainment and food is optional yet not necessary. I would recommend upgrading to the quiet zone for a few extra dollars. A number of us also travelled with bikes and other excess luggage, the airline was great in taking care of this and we travelled without an issue. I would defiantly recommend and will be returning to Malaysia with them in the future.", "air_title": "AirAsia ", "Customer_name": "Harry Wiles"}
