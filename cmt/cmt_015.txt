There was a self-service bar but they had run out of everything except water. The cabin crew did nothing except sitting in galley chatting with each other. They were not interested in us passengers at all. Air France is by far the worst airline i have traveled with. If you are going on a long haul flight with AF don't forget to bring some sandwiches with you because you might need it.", "air_title": "Air France ", "Customer_name": "P Williams"}
