This was the second leg of the journey from BKK to DPS, and despite the outdated regional J seats on this aircraft type, it was far more enjoyable than the previous leg. The crew were friendly and professional and the service was very nicely done. We were called by name throughout the flight, and rarely did a glass get below half full. Overall, quite satisfactory.", "air_title": "Singapore Airlines ", "Customer_name": "D Rose"}
