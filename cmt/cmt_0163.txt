I was allocated the worst seat on the plane seat no. 56G on the back row, my knees were pushed up against the seat in front, couldn't stretch my legs out under the seat in front because the seat was so close had to keep getting up to stretch my legs. I would like to know who allocates the seat number, its not the travel agent he can only request an aisle/window seat, is it Singapore Airlines at the time of booking (booked 5 months in advance) was it the only seat available? Is it the people who book 48 hours before on line or is it at check out at Manchester. I would have thought the back row was reserves for people on stand by or last minute bookings. Travelled many times with Singapore and always found them to be one of the best but not this time. Not a happy pensioner.", "air_title": "Singapore Airlines ", "Customer_name": "M Hopwood"}
