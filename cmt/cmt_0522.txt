A very comfortable trip in new airplanes (Dreamliner for one leg), helpful staff, very tasty food, and a great entertainment system. The change of planes in the middle of the night is not that great, but the advantage is that you quickly go to sleep on the second leg. In spite of the great flight experience I am a bit hesitant to choosing Qatar again given the reports on how they treat some of their staff.", "air_title": "Qatar Airways ", "Customer_name": "Marcus Nyberg"}
