Overall OK, food was OK, options finish quickly and you have to manage with what is available. Leg room was OK, restricted due to entertainment box under the seat. Few things that they may need to look into: Check in staff at Dubai yawning at 8am in morning, not as welcoming as we expected. Doha-Colombo sector, too cold inside the aircraft for many passengers, but, repeated request by us to make it a little warmer did not yield any result. Aircraft was clean and well maintained, good entertainment system and options. This was 1'st Qatar airline experience, will fly them again, but, not worth becoming loyal to them.", "air_title": "Qatar Airways ", "Customer_name": "Kumar Pankaj"}
