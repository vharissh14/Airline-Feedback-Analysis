Regularly upgrade to business class. Singapore's new planes are, for the most part, very good. There is, however, an increasing indifference to FF status in economy. The last three economy trips, Singapore sales staff on allocating seating have assured me that \"no aisle seats further forward are available\". When checking online, however, there have been several - it's just that the aisle seats have been beside other vacant seats.", "air_title": "Singapore Airlines ", "Customer_name": "M Cochrane"}
