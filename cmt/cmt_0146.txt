Flew A330 on all legs. Seats were comfortable, cabin crew were polite and friendly and entertainment was great. If there was any complaints it would be the lack of leg-room (I am 6ft 2') although it may be more than enough for a shorter person. Would definitely fly with again.", "air_title": "Singapore Airlines ", "Customer_name": "J Kethees"}
