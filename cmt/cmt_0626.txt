I had much higher hopes of Emirates than Qantas based on reputation alone. We booked row 52, extra leg room but as per seat guru, near to the galley which may prove 'bothersome'. On our first flight with Qantas this was not the case at all and I was pleasantly surprised by the quality of the service. However, bothersome was a massive understatement for the Emirates flights, though the only reason for this was the poor quality of the crew. My partner accurately described them as 'a bunch of arrogant teenagers on a school trip'. They were rude to passengers, they spent large amounts of the flight stuffing their faces with the food they hadn't finished serving to passengers and having loud conversations about their drunken escapades from the previous night. They didn't concentrate enough to realise they were spilling drinks on people and didn't worry about anyone hearing their squabbles about who was to blame for a complaint when an aisle was missed for food. On one particular occasion, 30 mins before landing, the announcement to prepare for landing was made and before it had even been spoken in English one of the crew shoved my TV and said ' put that down'. When I responded saying he needn't be so rude I was not met with an apology, I was met with 'It wasn't rude'. All in all, a terrible experience and I will be going out my way, regardless of any additional cost, to not fly with Emirates again.", "air_title": "Emirates ", "Customer_name": "Sam Low"}
