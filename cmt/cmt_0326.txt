Pros: nice food and wine, very good entertainment and service. Cons: although seat is indicated full flat, it is not possible for aircraft designed for short distance. Relatively low choice of magazines, no menu for food, they only show it to you very briefly. Very small overhead locker, even my specially designed cabin luggage would not fit into any locker of the ATR 72. Slightly chaotic situation if you change seats at check-in.", "air_title": "Singapore Airlines ", "Customer_name": "Van Hiep Hoang"}
