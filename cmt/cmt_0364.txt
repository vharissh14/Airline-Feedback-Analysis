Flight: AK139, Hong Kong (1050 dep) to Kuala Lumpur (KLIA2). This is the third airline review I am adding - the previous two I have literally just submitted using a 'minus points, plus points' format. I'm not sure that I can think of any minus points for this flight. There was nothing amazing about it, but it ticked the boxes that this low-cost airline pledged to tick. I have scored 3/5 for \"Food and Beverages\" because I am required to score, but I did not have any as I chose to bring my own on-board. However, what the airline offers is more substantial and far better-priced, and I would pre-book meals with them in future. As for \"Inflight Entertainment\", that is non-existent, as would be expected.", "air_title": "AirAsia ", "Customer_name": "M Walsh"}
