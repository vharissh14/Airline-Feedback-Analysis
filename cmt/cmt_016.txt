Would normally fly Swiss or Lufthansa but needed a late flight back from Atlanta so chose Air France. Have to say the premium economy seats are roomy, allowing me to work during the outward bound flight to USA, but they are very hard and do not recline properly so was not able to sleep much during the return night flight. Food was disappointing, I think Lufthansa offer the better choice of meals. Also the choice of drinks was poor, and the attendants were not too helpful. On the return journey they didn't distribute the kit with toothpaste, face mask etc. Choice of inflight films was quite good although the picture quality of the monitor was poor. Priority channel for boarding and check in is OK but CDG transfers and lounges are a nightmare, bursting to the seams with passengers, not enough seating, and not enough toilets.", "air_title": "Air France ", "Customer_name": "I Nutt"}
