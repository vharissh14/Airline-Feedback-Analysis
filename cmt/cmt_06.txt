Air France is without doubt the worst option in my opinion. Every time I have attempted to check in online, I have had an error message, and then when trying to check in electronically at the airport, I've had the same error message, and had to go queue and check in manually. On top of the inconvenience this causes, it also limits your seat choosing options. On 2 occasions, I've ended up in the 'middle' seat. Be warned, the arm rests are actually on this seat (as opposed to equally split between the two seats). That means that the seat is incredibly tight - I'm a 34\" waist, and it was uncomfortable - I imagine for anyone larger, it would become physically impossible. Overall, an incredibly arrogant airline. Avoid, and go with British Airways, or a budget alternative.", "air_title": "Air France ", "Customer_name": "H Thomas"}
