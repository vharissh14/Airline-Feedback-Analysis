My second trip with Qatar Airways. Crew and staff were very good at dealing with their tasks. Very friendly flight attendants. Food and Drinks were ok. 787 is a real dream. Very nice IFE system and also a nice atmosphere in the plane. A330 is also pretty decent, but IFE system could be newer. Overall no problems with transfer or baggage. Will fly with them next year too.", "air_title": "Qatar Airways ", "Customer_name": "Heidu Oliver"}
