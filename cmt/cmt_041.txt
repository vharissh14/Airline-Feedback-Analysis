One of the worst 11 hour flights ever. Got to my seat to find all of the electronics did not work. Notified staff before takeoff. There seemed to be some power to the electronics yet nothing worked. No light, no music, no monitor, not even the attendant call button. I was told they could somehow reboot the system associated with my seat shortly after takeoff. After a couple attempts to reboot and two hours trying to get the crew's focus on the matter I was finally told that they would not be able to get the electronics of my seat working. They offered me magazines which is completely useless considering they dim the cabin lights and I had no light of my own which worked. So I got to sit in the dark and 11 hours of flight going out of my mind with boredom. What makes it worse is knowing that this airline would not have known that my electrionoc were not functioning properly before the flight boarded. Not only did it limit me on my ability to view the safety video before the flight started, but it also brings into question why the systems did not work in the first place. The plane seemed fairly new and if the problems associated my electronics was not a simple rebooting of my system according to the crew, then what was it that cause all of the systems around my seat to fail?", "air_title": "Air France ", "Customer_name": "Ruhnke Henry"}
