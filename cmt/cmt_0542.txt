Flew from Doha to BKK on the A380. Booked business class but got an upgrade to 1st. (Been with Qatar Airways for several years). 1st Class is nice on the 380 but I'm not convinced of its value for money compared to regular business class. Food was 'so-so' although choice of beverages is excellent. Cabin crew were wonderful as always. Flew the A300-200 from Doha to Manchester (UK) business class and this plane is really showing its age now. Seats are not that comfortable for a 7 hr flight and again, the food was only just adequate. I think they must have changed caterers because only a year or so ago the food was always excellent.", "air_title": "Qatar Airways ", "Customer_name": "Middleton Steven"}
