Three matters are worthy of mention. Food was mixed. Inedible on one leg to outstanding on another. FA's on one of the legs very sloppy, with a nearby passenger fully reclined on take off and looking down the aisle counted three without seat belts on. Despite virtually no turbulence, seat belt sign displayed on for long periods. Finally, the FA's can best be described as 'curtly polite and efficient' - I echo the comment on 6/2/15 (Nagy) 'Their body language and facial expressions were often as if they'd rather be somewhere else'. Overall OK but do not deserve the praise often attributed to them and given options I would not travel with them again.", "air_title": "Emirates ", "Customer_name": "T Harvey"}
