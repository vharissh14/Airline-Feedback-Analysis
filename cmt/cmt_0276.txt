However for the first trip, I ordered the seafood meal. It was very disappointing. One of the seafood meals (breakfast) was just eggs and a little bacon (it looked like a low calorie meal). On my return trip, I opted for regular meals, all were satisfactory. I will never order seafood meals from SIA.", "air_title": "Singapore Airlines ", "Customer_name": "C Lin"}
