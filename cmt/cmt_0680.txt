All flights were on time, cabin crew and service excellent, meals pretty good. I really couldn't fault them. The angled lay flat seat on the 777-300 is comfy, and I never fully recline it to flat - I find it much more comfortable to put it into a kind of almost lying down lazy boy chair, so both ends raised slightly off flat. While I've read many poor reviews on the Business class seats in the A330-200 I have to say I found it very comfy. It definitely doesn't stack up against their long haul A380 seats, or even the 777-300, but I was very comfortable with the deep recline, great footrests ( so much room) and comfy leather seats. These aircraft's are usually only used on their shorter flights and in this situation I have no problems.", "air_title": "Emirates ", "Customer_name": "E Murray"}
