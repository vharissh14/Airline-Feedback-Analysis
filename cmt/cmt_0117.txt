Good flights. The 2x3x2 layout is poor, and the seat is almost flat. Some bumps in the seat when fully reclined and only a thin blanket provided. However I did sleep on both flights. Service was good. Didn't have dinner leaving Singapore so cannot comment, but had excellent food on leaving Paris. CDG lounge was spacious, with two levels making it seem less crowded. Little choice of food and no hot food. The cold food provided was good. Lovely spacious showers and facial treatment by Clarins beauty therapist was a treat, so long as you have time to to sign up for it.", "air_title": "Air France ", "Customer_name": "K Kan"}
