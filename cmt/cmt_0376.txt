The flight departed and arrived on time. Boarding in Penang smooth and efficient as was the arrival in Bangkok. The cabins are fresh and clean. Crew is efficient and accommodating. So, when the fares are reasonable, I see no reason not to give AirAsia top marks. It helps that DMK, although it looks a bit outdated, is more efficient than BKK by far. On a sidenote, the question on inflight entertainment is not relevant on a 2 hours flight but the inflight magazine is good, so high score here.", "air_title": "AirAsia ", "Customer_name": "Harald Faaberg"}
