The boarding process was a disaster with everybody wanting to go in at the same time and nobody tried to even control the flow of passengers. At check in they managed to put our daughter 8 years old in a different row than the parents. On the way back they managed to put our 2 children (5 and 8 years old) in row 6 and the parents in row 26. For a fee they could change seats - this is not normal in my eyes and it would have been normal to put us all in one row. The person who checked us in acted as if he was tired and doing all he could.", "air_title": "AirAsia ", "Customer_name": "Antoine van der Wielen"}
