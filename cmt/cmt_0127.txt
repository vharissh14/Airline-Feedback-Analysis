I have travelled long-haul a lot in the last few years to Australia and I would like to say I was extremely impressed by the quality of the flight attendants on Air France. They could not have been more courteous, helpful and considerate. The meals were a pleasant surprise too, better than I have experienced on other long haul flights.", "air_title": "Air France ", "Customer_name": "David Crichton"}
