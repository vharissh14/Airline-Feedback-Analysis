Half full so it really felt like a private jet with around 18 passengers. I sat in the rear section with one other gentleman so we had about 20 seats to ourselves! However, now I've tried it I'll probably revert to the bigger jets next time as they are smoother, quieter and more spacious.", "air_title": "Qatar Airways ", "Customer_name": "P Lewis"}
