Everything about it was as you expect. Chosen for the exceptional price at the best times of day. Flights left on time/arrived early. Brand new aircraft. Only thing off-putting were the 'threats' about drinking alcohol on the flights and having future bookings cancelled as a consequence, but I guess on a route like this they regularly get trouble.", "air_title": "AirAsia ", "Customer_name": "C Miller"}
