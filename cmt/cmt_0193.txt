Jakarta to London. First leg, B777-200. Old but clean. I like the fact that SQ offers various dietary menu even for economy class passengers. Ordered a fruit platter and was superb. Second leg B777-300ER year 2006 cabin. Cabin a bit old but clean. Nice food, attentive flight attendants. Although flight was full service standards did not go down. Two thumbs up, as always.", "air_title": "Singapore Airlines ", "Customer_name": "Siauw Steve"}
