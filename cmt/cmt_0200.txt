I recently had a block of five flights with Singapore Airlines. The first thing you notice is that they have a modern fleet of aircraft's, the cabins are fresh and clean and importantly use the latest technology for passenger use. The service is extremely good, onboard the stewardesses are very friendly and efficient as they serve passengers and smile which makes a big difference. The new aircraft's have the better seats, they are quite wide for economy the backs give good support but the most important thing for me was the cushioning it seemed about right and after a 14 hour flight on a 777 I found it to be one of the best seats I have sat in on a plane. All flights were very good and I would use them again.", "air_title": "Singapore Airlines ", "Customer_name": "Robert Adams"}
