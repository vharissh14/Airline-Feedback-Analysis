Athens to Doha on an A321. The entertainment system didn't show any flight info or map. Doha to Bangkok - 1.5 hours into the flight they served a small snack - a spinach pie for vegetarians or chicken pie. After some 5 hours they served a small breakfast - nothing special for an 8 hours flight. The plane was an A380 which was the best of the 4 we travelled on during this trip. At least it was clean and comfortable for a long flight. For the SIN-DOH leg they used a B787 which was new but uncomfortable for tall passengers. Once seats recline it's practically impossible to eat or stand up. The breakfast 1 hour before Doha was so bad thst we gave it back untouched. Doha to Athens entertainment system at seat did not work but the A330 was not full so we could change seats. They served the same breakfast as SIN-DOH. The A330 was full of dust - the seat pocket was full of garbage from the last flight.", "air_title": "Qatar Airways ", "Customer_name": "Akritidis Dimitrios"}
