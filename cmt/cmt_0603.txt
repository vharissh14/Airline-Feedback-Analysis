This is my second and last flight with EK in business class and I had hoping for a better experience with them the second time around. This did not happen. The crew looked bored and as though they did not want to be there. They missed our welcome drink and I had to ask for ours as they collected everyone else's empty glasses. Then during the service the crew kept forgetting which rows they had served. A drink and nuts after take off were offered and then it was almost two hours before we were offered our first course. The fun started trying to get a glass of wine. They do not serve wine automatically with the meal like other airlines and instead walk around with a type of wine rack with a few glasses on it. Good luck getting their attention to get a glass. They walked past us three times while we sat looking at them expecting a glass of wine with our entree. I was served red but my partner was ignored. I rang my call bell and they arrived to see what could be wrong with me. A few minutes later the same FA walked past offering bread and no wine. At this point I lost my temper and could not believe what was happening. My partner had finished the entree and not had a drink for over two hours ago by now. Eventually the white wine came and the rest of the service was ordinary. They had no idea which wines they were serving or where they came from. It was just red or white and you pointed at which one you wanted. The food was very average quite boring. To me this airline just lacks soul. The IFE was good and the ground staff at SIN airport and the lounge were delightful. Just such a disappointing onboard experience.", "air_title": "Emirates ", "Customer_name": "Rawlings Scott"}
