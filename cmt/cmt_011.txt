The first leg from BCN had drama. It was the last flight of a day when a flight had been cancelled earlier, and seating was overbooked. I was assigned a middle seat. One of the flaws of their intra-Europe flights is that you cannot ever book your seat in advance, and I paid for my ticket 8 months in advance! Previously, I was served a meal on this short flight, but not this one. We were only given a small, dry sandwich and a cup of water (no second drinks service). The flight attendant in charge seemed to care less about anyone in the \"premium cabin\". Air France make no effort to distinguish the intra-Europe premium economy experience apart from you being seated near the front. The late night flight to HND on a newly refurbished 777-200 was actually quite nice. The crew were very accommodating and the toilets were clean throughout. The premium economy seat was OK, but you cannot get any sleep in them, as many have said. The entertainment system is updated with touch screens, though I couldn't find much to watch. I ordered a special Lentore meal in advance and it was delicious. The standard pre-arrival breakfast was dreadful. No food offered between meal times during the 11+ hour flight. The only good thing about being in premium economy is knowing you're not squeezed into economy. Overall, not a very positive experience for me this journey.", "air_title": "Air France ", "Customer_name": "Brian E Smith"}
