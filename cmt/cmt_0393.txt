Melb - KL, Sydney - KL. Recently, Air Asia tried to rename the premium class to business class. I found the word business class really misleading because it is not a business class yet, premium seat is more like it. Well, whatever name you call it, you cannot only book the \"new business class\" to and from Kuala Lumpur. If you are flying out to and from any Malaysia small city, you are blocked from booking the business class. The implication is that, the passenger need to purchase multiple itineraries and no luggage check through to the final destination. Why is Air Asia doing this? It is very inconvenient for business man like us when we need to rush from one gate to another and what more to say rushing to collect luggage and check in again. Imagine with the new KLIA2. One has to be really fit to do the long walk and keep the figure cross that he/she can locate the other gate safely. I travel a lot in the \"old premium class\", sometimes it is value for money when it is on offer. There is not much service and no entertainment, but it comes with free meals and luggage. It is not that exclusive anyway, economy class passenger can just walk pass you anytime anyhow.", "air_title": "AirAsia ", "Customer_name": "Wai Kuen"}
