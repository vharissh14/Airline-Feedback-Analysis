On reaching DEL airport there was only one check-in counter open and no one seemed interested - most flights were cancelled, the lounge had no food, only soft drinks and water with only one attendant. The return flight was rescheduled and we were sent via Udaipur, effectively increasing our travel time by 2 hrs. When we asked for lounge access staff at Jaipur had no problems telling us that there were payment issues and lounge has been discontinued - no apology for cancelling.", "air_title": "Kingfisher Airlines ", "Customer_name": "Ajay Nair"}
