Last year we travelled with Air France to Paris from Melbourne and as experience and price were good we did again this month. I do not understand the criticisms of this airline. Both our experiences have been excellent. Yes, the seats are not lie flat but they were particularly comfortable for sitting. The crew on both occasions were extremely friendly and attentive, the food and wine was of a high standard and entertainment had plenty of choices. We think this is very good value for money and will continue to fly Air France when we can.", "air_title": "Air France ", "Customer_name": "A Curran"}
