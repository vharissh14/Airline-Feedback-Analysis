Qatar is pleasant and reliable, food was below average even for Economy, cabin was about 80% full so was able to get an open seat next to me. Entertainment is average, not as comprehensive or as up to date as Emirates. Staff were ok but somehow seem cool and disengaged, or at least not as personable as on other carriers, 777 aircraft was fine, service was on time, new Doha airport is very handsome and much improved with great lounge space accessible to frequent travelers even holding Economy seats. Not clear why Doha sometimes still uses bus connections to remote parking for arriving flights.", "air_title": "Qatar Airways ", "Customer_name": "R Sprow"}
