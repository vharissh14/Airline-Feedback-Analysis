Both flights were very nice, some turbulence but nothing too bad, crew very attentive and friendly. Food was also very good (they served dinner and breakfast on both flights) and drinks were available throughout the whole flight. For the money I paid I got great value. Neither flight was delayed, it took off and landed on time. I will definitely fly Air France again, especially to Brazil.", "air_title": "Air France ", "Customer_name": "T Jones"}
