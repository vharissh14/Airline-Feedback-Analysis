Very disappointed in the shabby, scuffed and old cabin. The seats were narrow (compared to 777-300ER and A380) and did not lie fully flat (this should be standard for a premium airline). I had some emails to send and found that there was no wifi available (again this is offered on their 777-300ER and A380). I wouldn't mind if there was a discount for this plane model, but for Singapore Airlines high prices passengers deserve better.", "air_title": "Singapore Airlines ", "Customer_name": "Smith Dean"}
