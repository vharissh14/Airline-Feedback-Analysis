Ever since SQ removed the A380 from Australian flights, their value for money is no longer there. The biggest problem is the IFE. During my flight, the IFE was not working, the movie would break in the middle of the show and during some of the time, the voice would disappear. Even with twice re-booting, the IFE was not working. During the time that the IFE was working, the screen is so small and the picture so blurred that it became impossible to see the picture. The adjustment of the brightness was also futile. Hello SQ, these aircraft's should be retired as they are degrading your brand name and definitely not worth the money we are paying for. Even Vietnam Airlines now will be flying the A350 and the B787-900 to Melbourne soon. I'm really disappointed.", "air_title": "Singapore Airlines ", "Customer_name": "Kenny Ho"}
