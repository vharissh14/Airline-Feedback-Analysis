KUL-CGK on 12/26 and CGK-SIN on 12/30. Both flights experienced delays. The first was due to arriving aircraft (two hours) and the second was due to ATC in SIN (boarded on time, but one hour delay on the plane). The seats were comfortable for the short flights. The legroom was also adequate. I'm 5'11\" (180 cm) and I had a small amount of space in between my knees and the seat in front of me. That being said, for a long flight, three hours plus, it would get a bit tiring. I pre-ordered a meal which tasted fine. Unfortunately, it was on a flight that was delayed for two hours and departed after Midnight and I had already eaten the same meal unknowingly twice before. Definitely wasn't in the mood. The price is cheap, sure, but expect a two hour delay every time which means lots of waiting. For our flight KUL-CGK, there was no announcement of any delay until after the scheduled departure time (but they kept making announcements for other delays). Bring your patience for sure.", "air_title": "AirAsia ", "Customer_name": "Michael Hollifield"}
