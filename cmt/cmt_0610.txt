Boarding in AMS was a joke. The economy class pax blocked the way to the gate exit to the aircraft. The ground staff did nothing here when boarding for the first and business class passengers began. Chaos was the word that came to my mind. About 20 minutes delay on departure. Food was of poor quality. The inflight service no better than any other 4-star airline. The seats are acceptable and provide ample space. We were transported by bus to the terminal upon arrival in Dubai. This took about 20 minutes. Another 20 minutes walk to the to the train for transport to the next terminal and another 15 minutes to get to the lounge. What happened to their so-called famous A380 terminal where all A380 aircraft can be handeld. Lounge was OK. Flight EK384, DXB-BKK on 8/2/2015 in business class. No exciting flight. What you can expected for the price you paid for business class. Food was mediocre. FA were friendly and gave good service. Flight EK385, BKK-DXB on 19/2/2015. Again an uneventful flight with food less than mediocre. FA's acceptable. Flight EK147, DXB-AMS. The best of the four legs. FA omnipresent and very friendly. Food was good. The waiting times when changing flights in Dubai made traveling quite tiring. I think it will remain at this one experience with Emirates when travelling to South East Asia.", "air_title": "Emirates ", "Customer_name": "W Giesberts"}
