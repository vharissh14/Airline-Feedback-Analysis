Great to have this direct route and seems very popular especially for connections. Second time I have used this service third trip with Qatar. 787 economy seats uncomfortable, the 3-3-3 configuration a strange choice. A330 service I flew on in June 2014, DOH-HKG seats were much more comfortable and 2-4-2 better. Metal box on floor on 787 restricts leg room. Leg room tight and unbearable when passenger in front reclines their seat (better leg room on Easyjet a low frills airline). Emirates 777 seats better from GLA-DXB. Cabin service and crew were good on this trip.", "air_title": "Qatar Airways ", "Customer_name": "K Wardrop"}
