Recently flew from MNL-SIN-DEL. MNL-SIN on a fully loaded B777, the aircraft is up for retirement but it is spotlessly clean and well maintained. The IFE was ancient but for such a short flight, I did not mind it. Food was decent and cabin crew were as efficient and reliable as one should expect from SQ. Had a 6 hour layover in Changi, which is without a doubt, SQ's best asset. It's an airport beyond compare and would not mind a longer layover. Flight to DEL on the A380 with less than 100 passengers. Cabin crew were very laid back and allowed passengers to move about the cabin. The seats were extremely comfortable and food was excellent. Service calls were answered in record time, and while, one of the flight attendants was a tad cold, one of the lead flight attendants embodied professionalism and warmth which made up for it. IFE kept malfunctioning and the movie kept pausing every 30 seconds or so, which was annoying. Besides that one minor issue, I would fly SQ again. They are extremely reliable, their hard product is among the best, and while their service is inconsistent when it comes to friendliness, their efficiency is one of the best out there.", "air_title": "Singapore Airlines ", "Customer_name": "Jezrel Sabaduquia"}
