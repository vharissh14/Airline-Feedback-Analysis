On-board, the seat was great. Great food and beverage service. IFE was spot on too. DOH-DAC on A330 They used First Class seating as J seating so I managed to get a flat-bed. Food and beverage on that leg was not great, dry possibly due to a delay out of DOH also the IFE has to be reset several times. Return sectors RGN-DOH was on the A330 comfortable seat once again the food from RGN wasn't great but I was hungry so ate it. DOH-LHR was on the Business One A319 aircraft. Comfortable Seats, IFE didn't work properly (kept skipping) but I needed to sleep and I think I got about five hours.", "air_title": "Qatar Airways ", "Customer_name": "Denzil Bourne"}
