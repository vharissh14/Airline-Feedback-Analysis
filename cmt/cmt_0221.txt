SQ25, 8/23. Singapore to Heathrow to Boston. SQ308, 8/30. We were very impressed with Singapore Airlines service from beginning to end. The food/beverage service was unlike any we have ever had on an airplane. The flight crew was more attentive than I have experienced at an elegant restaurant! The access to and variety of entertainment (movies and music) exceeded our expectations. The \"little extras\" (such as hot towels at the beginning and end of each flight, socks, and toothbrushes) were a pleasant and welcome surprise. Overall, Singapore Airlines made a grueling 24hr flight much more tolerable! The only criticisms I would offer are the poor leg room (particularly in the middle section), and the location of the security check-in prevented the use of restrooms, restaurants, and shopping after going through security. We usually check in early enough to ensure there is ample time to handle any issues that could arise, and then we use the restrooms/eat/fill water bottles/shop/etc after we are all set for the flight.", "air_title": "Singapore Airlines ", "Customer_name": "L Ayasse"}
