Beijing - Singapore, however SQ 223, 25 April 2014, Singapore - Perth, what a shambles, full flight, cabin staff were more interested in 'special meals etc'. Eventually after a 1.5 hour delay we were served lunch, you read about staff not answering call button, this happened to us, eventually our call was answered, there was definitely a problem. No coffee and tea was brought around, eventually my husband took our meal trays down to the back galley only to be met with oh! We forgot! On leaving the aircraft - there was not one cabin crew member to be seen.", "air_title": "Singapore Airlines ", "Customer_name": "L Holmes"}
