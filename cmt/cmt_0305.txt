I have flown with them before but quite few years ago so assumed they would of gone downhill like so many airlines but what a pleasant surprise nothing had changed! Great service from the cabin crew, comfortable seating, really nice food and best of all a brilliant IFE system. I have flown with Cathay Pacific and Malaysian a lot and they are good but no where near the same class as Singapore.", "air_title": "Singapore Airlines ", "Customer_name": "T Kimberley"}
