Of course the service could not be faulted. The main problem we had with our return trip is that we had medium haul 777 and on the way over the much more comfortable long haul product. The medium haul has an inclined bed seat that is far too hard and not at all comfortable whilst the long haul has the fully flat (and deliciously soft) bed- more like a cubby than a bed). It was a bit disappointing. As it was a midnight flight both ways, the ides of offering meals just after take off or two hours before landing is a great one but the breakfasts on both trips were terrible, on the way home, inedible. I know the food in economy is much better.", "air_title": "Singapore Airlines ", "Customer_name": "J Stevens"}
