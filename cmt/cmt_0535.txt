We had lie flat beds Perth to Doha. These are excellent even if you don't want to sleep but just want to stretch out. The cabin service was the best I have experienced in Business Class. You can have your meals when you want them. The service was always there and always excellent without being obtrusive. We will certainly be flying with Qatar again this year.", "air_title": "Qatar Airways ", "Customer_name": "Becu John"}
