Whilst the crew were brilliant and the food remained very good, there have been some major changes in terms of beverages. Champagne has disappeared. Outbound LHR- BOM, we were offered a pre-dinner drink but when I asked for red wine with dinner, there wasn't any. Return BOM-LHR, I asked for a pre-lunch gin and tonic, and soon afterwards the stewardess returned to say there was no gin. All the above may sound minor and petty, but Kingfisher First used to be best in the sky and is supposed to be a premium product. It's a terrible shame - not least because the cabin staff really work hard and could not have been more pleasant.", "air_title": "Kingfisher Airlines ", "Customer_name": "Hugh Saville"}
