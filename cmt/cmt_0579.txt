B777-300ERs all legs. First time on EK and must say I was impressed, certainly compared to QF long haul. Able to use the Qantas lounge in ADL due to QF status, nothing out of the ordinary but you need to allow time to pass through immigration etc at the gate. Boarding started well ahead of time (on all legs) and was strictly by seating zone which worked well and lead to on time departures all 4 legs. I prefer an aisle seat and on 3 of the 4 legs the middle seat was unoccupied. Chose the small Y class section just behind business which was good. I found the seat and leg room good but then I am quite short. Note that aisle seats don't always have power plugs but the USBs worked well. ICE was impressive but the relentless ads got a bit annoying after a while even though you can fast forward them. Service was universally good and friendly, albeit with the inevitable slightly \"plastic\" airline feel to it. Hot towels, menus, small amenity kit. Food was more than adequate on all legs and always got my preference. Trays cleared away promptly, regular drinks runs and staff seemed to respond to individual calls. Liked the mood lighting overnight and slept well. Transit in DXB worked well, no long lines at security even a peak hours. One bus transfer but very efficient. Used the lounge in DXB - yes, its big but just move away from the central hub and there are lots of quiet spots to chill out. All in all I was happy with my flights and would certainly use EK again on these experiences.", "air_title": "Emirates ", "Customer_name": "M Langran"}
