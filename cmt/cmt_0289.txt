All with Singapore Airlines. Every flight was quite simply the best I have experienced. I actually found myself looking forward to a meal on a plane. All aspects were fast, efficient, friendly and professional. Economy seats on the 777 are far better than any other airline I have flown, IFE was very good with a wide selection, all flights on time and onboard staff very good. Quite simply I can see why they are always rated so highly.", "air_title": "Singapore Airlines ", "Customer_name": "B Le Quesne"}
