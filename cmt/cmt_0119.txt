Arriving at Paris there was a long wait before we could disembark, then about 20 mins in bus to terminal building. Not the efficient service we are used to in Singapore! On return flight we experienced bad turbulence (worst we frequent fliers had ever experienced). At no point did the captain speak to the passengers to apologize, explain or reassure and, as it was night, the FAs were nowhere to be seen. Furthermore, 3 TVs for my family of 5 were not working, and all the FAs did was repeatedly restart the system. We asked to change seats as plane was not full, but had to organize with with other passengers to ensure our kids weren't sitting alone. I did not feel the FAs' English was good enough to deal with this problem competently. They did the minimum during the whole flight. Food was okay but I would've expected Air France to serve better.", "air_title": "Air France ", "Customer_name": "R Lloyd"}
