First leg ARN-DOH operated by a Boeing 787-8, was quite excited to fly on the B787 for the first time. We had checked in online so no long queues for us! Boarding was done on-time and efficiently. I was quite impressed with the lighting in the cabin, however it felt fairly cramped in a 9-abreast configuration. The flight was about 80% full. Legroom was decent, food was great, the IFE was great and the flight attendants were very friendly and attentive. Transfer in Doha was smooth, the next flight DOH-DAC operated by an A333. Plane change from two class A333 to three class A333. Our chosen seats got changed, the staff handled the situation well and new seats were given. My father was placed in business and the rest of us in economy. Flight was about 95% full. Once again a great experience with friendly flight attendants, great IFE and decent legroom. Only one option for the meal, which was okay, nothing special. Return flight DAC-DOH operated by a two class A333. Fight was 100% full. Friendly and attentive crew as usual, boarding was done efficiently. We had a great flight with excellent service as usual, however the only let down was the food. Transfer in Doha-Hamad was smooth. Lovely airport. We had a pleasant flight as usual, but the food was still quite bad. We were offered with one option, which is quite bad IMO. We were able to choose from a handful of options on the outbound flight (ARN-DOH). However, I had excellent flights with QR nonetheless and I would gladly choose them again in the future!", "air_title": "Qatar Airways ", "Customer_name": "R Nazmul"}
