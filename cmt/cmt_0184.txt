Consistently great service in all four flights, the cabin crew were very attentive. Food and drinks were excellent in generous servings, and the movie selection on IFE is more than acceptable. I always love their signature cocktail, Singapore Sling. The seat was a lot more spacious than I expected, after having flown with other airlines in the US the month before. I thoroughly enjoyed all flights, although having an empty seat next to me in all 4 flights might be one of the key contributing factors. I am a frequent flyer, and I have to say this trip is one of the best I have had.", "air_title": "Singapore Airlines ", "Customer_name": "C Chan"}
