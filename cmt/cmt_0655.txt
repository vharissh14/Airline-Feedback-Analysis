Traveled on an A380 on 3 legs of our trip and seat size + legroom was not very comfortable for a 14 hour flight. There is hardly any space to stretch or walk around a bit on the flight. Staff was courteous and polite however service wasn't quick enough but I think that's just due to the number of passengers on the flight. At one point it took them more than an hour to collect our plates after we finished our meal. Food was okay, nothing great or exceptional. In- flight entertainment was the only best part about the flight, screen is great plus they have a good collection of movies etc.", "air_title": "Emirates ", "Customer_name": "P Archana"}
