So with a change in Doha 4 different flights and they all vary. The flights to London were good and especially the first leg with excellent service from the staff. Good food too. But the return was less good. Especially the final leg Doha to Bangkok. We left Doha around 1am and it would have been nice to get a good meal to settle us down for the 6 hour flight, but they just brought us a miserable sandwich. 2 hours before arriving into Bangkok - around 10 am - I expected a nice breakfast - nothing too heavy - but the food options were dinner-based - so beef or chicken with veg, etc. I think we just wanted eggs or croissants with coffee. I've flown with Qatar many times and I find the service quite variable. The stop-over in Doha, bus connections is now a drag.", "air_title": "Qatar Airways ", "Customer_name": "K Sanger"}
