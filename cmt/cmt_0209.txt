As an athlete, I had to travel with my equipment which are large in size and heavy. On the first leg, the check in process was smooth as there were no lines although the plane was full. We were scheduled to fly on a 777-200/200ER, but due to maintenance issues, they instead used a 777-300ER, which has better seats, IFE and was spotless clean inside out. Boarding process was quick, and flight attendants greeted everyone with a smile and addressed some of the passengers by name. What disappointed me was that they did not switch on the much expected IFE until almost halfway through the journey, and to my surprise, the food was both below standard (I tried both options). On the leg back, they used the 777-300 classic series which was also clean inside out. Seamless boarding process yet again, and great food. I shopped from the SilverKris magazine for the special F1 merchandise, and it was a smooth process as well. But to my disappointment, they did not switch on the IFE at all. For the time being I will opt for SkyTeam carriers Garuda Indonesia and Air France which allows me to pay less but get the same results.", "air_title": "Singapore Airlines ", "Customer_name": "Rafi Pramadio"}
