I want to review my long-haul flight. First, it was 2 hours delay and I missed my next flight to Denpasar. Passengers didn't receive any free food/drinks while waiting for the aircraft to be ready. Paris CDG terminal 2E had serious problems with their toilets. 2 or 3 male's toilets had been flooded. I was lucky enough to select a seat at the back and I had the whole row to my disposal. However, all monitors in the row was dirty from a previous flight. Window glass was dirty. Flight attendants were attentive and smiling. However, they provided service twice during 11 hour flight: dinner and breakfast. No drinks offered after dinner. Trays with soft drinks (no wine, no beer) had been placed nearby kitchen and staff were lounging in their area. I'm always travelling between Asia and Europe, and I booked combined ticket from Bangkok to London by KLM and London to Bangkok by Air France. What a difference! Fantastic KLM staff, great food, fair drinks, and cold drinks served every hour during the night flight. Not on Air France flight. Would I choose them again for long-haul flight. I would avoid them.", "air_title": "Air France ", "Customer_name": "Vasily Pr"}
