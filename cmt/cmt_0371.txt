I will return to Thailand the same way. I am an Australian, but have lived in Asia for the past 22 years. Air Asia has grown and improved remarkably over the past few month. The crew, service, food, cleanliness of the planes are all now far superior than in the past. It is a low cost carrier, but now it doesn't feel so much that way.", "air_title": "AirAsia ", "Customer_name": "Susanne Elizabeth Ultmann"}
