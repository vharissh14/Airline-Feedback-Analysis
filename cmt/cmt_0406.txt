I checked in online and got the boarding pass. Since I had no checked-in baggage, I went straight to the immigration counter, which was very convenient and save a lot of time. The flight was delayed for 1.5 hours. Luckily the ground staff provided us with a simple meal. The flight was not full. I had the whole row to myself so that I could lie down during the entire flight. Of course the flight arrived late. The FA was ok. The seat pitch is a little bit short for me. I didn\u0092t order any on-board meal as I just had dinner prior to the flight.", "air_title": "AirAsia ", "Customer_name": "R Fitra"}
