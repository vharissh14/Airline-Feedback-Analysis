Very chaotic Boarding and unpleasant bus ride to the aircraft. Over 25 minutes delayed towards scheduled arrival on a 1 hour flight without any information or apologies whatsoever. Coffee with small bakery snack OK. flight attendants professional and friendly. Had an exit row without paying any additional fees - good seat (10F). Overall OK but prefer flying with airlines where you do not have to use buses to board.", "air_title": "Air France ", "Customer_name": "M Schweizer"}
