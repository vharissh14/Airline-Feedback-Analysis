Ground staff in Seoul gave me a random seat - last row with no recline - despite my pre- assignment and my SkyPriority standing. The food was good and service in-flight satisfactory. KLM, which flew me on the final leg, delivered my luggage a day later, though the efficiency in its tracking was high. The Charles de Gaulle Terminal 2F lounge was overcrowded. The return trip was satisfactory overall-meaning they need better training for their Seoul-based staff. Unpleasant and unprofessional.", "air_title": "Air France ", "Customer_name": "J Kwak"}
