The worst business Class seat, too wide, no support, hard as a rock. You can't sit comfortably in any position and it is pathetic to lie on. My back actually aching on arrival. Never again. Food lousy, choice too small, service without a smile and even then only when you asked. No pyjamas SIN to London and one meal served with no cloth at all. Used to be great. Flying back Emirates, and saving $1250 per seat on top.", "air_title": "Singapore Airlines ", "Customer_name": "John Marles"}
