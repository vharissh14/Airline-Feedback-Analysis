Having heard of the really good reputation of Emirates, I was looking for to it. I was rapidly disappointed with a very basic service, more than average food and their ICE entertainment system really not user friendly with a lack of movie choices. By experience, there are far better airlines on offer for a better price too. Travelling back to Australia in a couple of weeks, hopefully they will prove me wrong.", "air_title": "Emirates ", "Customer_name": "Foin Valery"}
