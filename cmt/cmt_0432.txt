I must say that fares aren't that much cheaper than full service airlines, if you only book a few weeks in advance. There are a lot of additional fees, some of which are not avoidable. If you have to change your flight, you will get clobbered. Check-in was another problem. Their website says that international check-in opens 3 hours before the flight - not true. The check-in did not open until 2 hours before. Once it did, the queue did move at a painfully slow pace. The agent seem to have problems with every person checking in and had to call the supervisor over more than once for every passenger. I'd checked in online but not printed my boarding pass (as I had a mobile one sent to my mobile). This caused a lot of problems and needed the supervisor. Once through security, everything was a breeze. Organised boarding, great cabin crew, clean plane, comfortable seats and good food. I'd check to see how much you're actually saving before using Air Asia. If its enough, then book it.", "air_title": "AirAsia ", "Customer_name": "Martinez Gregory"}
