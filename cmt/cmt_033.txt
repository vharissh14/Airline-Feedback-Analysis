I find the seat comfortable in sleeping and \"up\" position. Nice crew and excellent catering. Unfortunately the IFE system was not working (purser informed passengers before boarding) but was therefor forced to sleep and arrived fresh. My only critic is the worn out impression of the cabin. The marketing campaigns from AF are not a true reflection of the real situation of their planes, this B777 looked old, bad maintained and dirty.", "air_title": "Air France ", "Customer_name": "M Buenk"}
