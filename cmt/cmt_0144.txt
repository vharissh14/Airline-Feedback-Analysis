I was very disappointed with the first class. The last time I did First was to New York about 4+ years ago on the ageing 747 that was far better an experience. Pre-flight details were excellent using the Private Dining in T3 Changi. However the food on board was terrible. My wife ordered the Japanese Kaiseki and it was not good. My Wagyu Sirloin was leather tough.However Dom Perignon 2004 did help to wash it down. Fortunately the flight back form Seoul on Business was excellent with good food. I think SQ need to re-look at their inflight food standard outbound from SIN.", "air_title": "Singapore Airlines ", "Customer_name": "T L Yang"}
