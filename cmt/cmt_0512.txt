I took the night flight and I arrived rested in Germany, 30 minutes earlier than expected so I was able to change my connecting flight within Germany and arrived earlier at my final destination in Germany. On my return to CMB in Frankfurt the ground handling staff were very impolite firstly when they didn't know which class I was in, suddenly when they saw my ticket a smile appeared, this shouldn't be, every customer should be treated the same way. The flight from FRA to DOH had a delay therefore the connecting time to DOH to CMB was only 30 minutes. As earlier stated in some of the reviews from others, some of the planes business class is just a better economic class, as you are unable to rest. However I wouldn't mind recommending the airline.", "air_title": "Qatar Airways ", "Customer_name": "Daniel Ludwig"}
