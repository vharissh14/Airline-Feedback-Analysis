QZ8320, 23 Mar 2014, CGK-DMK (A320). Website check-in is convenient, CGK check-in agents are good and smiling and oblige if you want to change to an Aisle seat. Boarding in CGK is utter chaos and staff are in Go away Go away mode. Again, Crew welcoming and point to your seat (the Weekend uniform is extremely untidy it kills the image). Announcements again so fast. Safety demonstrations are very good and clear to the point. Food again looks like it has been recycled 2 or more flights, I had pre-booked meal (Satay with Asian Fried rice). Again no information that it contained Shrimp paste (I'm allergic to Seafood). On landing the announcements were so fast. Overall I will fly them again, but as I said in my previous comment will bring my own food and water.", "air_title": "AirAsia ", "Customer_name": "Sandesh Kshatriya"}
