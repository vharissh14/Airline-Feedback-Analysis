Obviously a very bad flight, once again due to a very bad crew. But still nothing you can compare with rude, disorganized and idiot ground staff at ORY. Bus shuttle to CDG was to pay despite of integrated flight ticket. EUR 21 for 20 km. What a crockery. Delayed 20 minutes, chaotic driving style, driver was screaming me like a jail keeper as I complained about it.
