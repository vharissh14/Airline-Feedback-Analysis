ARN-DOH operated by a B787 and DOH-DAC operated by an A333. We had checked in online the night before so no long queues for us! Boarding was fast and efficient at ARN as usual. Was quite excited to fly on the 787 for the first time and I was fairly impressed by the mood lighting in the cabin. However, the cabin felt quite cramped in this 9-abreast configuration. The load factor in Y was approximately 80%. The seats were decent, the IFE was modern, flight attendants were friendly and attentive and the food was great. Overall, a great experience on this 6 hour flight. Transfer was smooth in the new Hamad airport. Next flight DOH- DAC on an A333. They changed the operating aircraft to a three class A333. The staff at DOH handled the situation well and new seats were given. My father got seated in business and the rest of us in Y. Flight was 95-100% full in Y. Overall a nice flight with friendly crew, decent IFE and decent seats. The only letdown was the food. DAC- DOH operated by an A333 once again, the flight was completely packed in business and economy. Boarding was smooth and we were off to DAC. Flight was great as usual with QR, nice crew, decent IFE and decent seats. The food was quite tasteless and once again, the only letdown with this flight. Transfer in Doha was smooth as usual. DOH-ARN operated by A7-BCB, I had bought the same plane in 1:200 from DOH. Load factor in Y was about 80-85%. The flight was great as usual except the food, arrival at ARN was smooth. I was quite satisfied with QR except on the catering department. We chose QR because of the low fares and I would recommend them if the price is competitive.", "air_title": "Qatar Airways ", "Customer_name": "R Nazmul"}
