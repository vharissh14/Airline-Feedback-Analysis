Flight departed around 30 minutes later than scheduled, but overall the flight was smooth and we arrived on time. Seat was uncomfortably wide, but made better by the 2 cushions on each side. It was a pity that the seat, including the storage compartments, looked dirty, old and worn. Maintenance could have been better - have seen older but cleaner A330 from Asiana. Food-wise is the usual Business Class fare, nothing spectacular but was of good quality and quantity. Service was prompt and friendly.", "air_title": "Singapore Airlines ", "Customer_name": "Lau Ni"}
