Perth - Doha flight - usual B777. Full flight but cabin crew maintained a good friendly service. Have used Qatar over last few years on this run. Standard of food has gone down quite noticeably and beverage service not as frequent as in past (although a full flight could explain this). IFE very poor and aircraft seemed \"grubby\" (clean but well used). Doha - Man. Airbus 330. Seats tight in width but good IFE, aircraft appeared very new. Flight 2/3rds full but cabin service was very poor. Cabin crew sullen, only appeared at food serving time and seemed to spend rest of flight sitting on their crew seats looking very unhappy (they did not even appear to chat to each other). Certainly the worst long haul cabin crew i have experienced (the one exception being Iberia on a trip to Argentina). Maybe this was a one off, but certainly I will now consider an alternative airline for this run.", "air_title": "Qatar Airways ", "Customer_name": "Ian Francis"}
