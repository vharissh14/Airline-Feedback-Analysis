Outbound leg on the older 777, but the seat was comfortable enough. IFE was also the older system but worked well and the headphones were excellent (after a broken pair was replaced). Crew generally good and attentive, although some far better than others and the service was a bit abrupt at times with items being almost snatched away. Inbound flight left SIN at 1.30am, dinner served about an hour into the flight then lights out. Used the 'book the cook' service, outbound monkfish as excellent, return curry a bit hotter than I was expecting but good quality.", "air_title": "Singapore Airlines ", "Customer_name": "S Paice"}
