There was no topper pad for the seat so very uncomfortable to try and sleep. This is a 10 hour flight so it was not up to scratch. These days you really expect more in Business class. There are also 6 seats across so there is not a lot of room to spread out. The food was only just acceptable but as the flight left at 1am we didn't feel like much anyway. I think Singapore need to review their fares on this aircraft as it was barely a step up from premium economy on other airlines. The way back SIN-CHC is the refurbished 777 with a lie flat bed and 4 seats across. A quite different experience. A lot more room and even though it feels a bit weird to sleep diagonally it was fine. 2 comfy pillows. I had tried to book the cook but I didn't think it had worked online as couldn't see it in our booking but on arriving home found confirmation emails that it had, but we didn't get our requested meals on the plane so don't know what happened there. The food was really good anyway. Service was fantastic from the crew, in fact it was the best part of the experience. In Singapore they allowed our two sons (21 and 17)who were travelling with us but in economy to come into the lounge as we had 6 hours there which was really appreciated. On both trips the movie selection was dismal and the only amenities given out were a pair of slippers and an eye mask . There were some toothbrushes in the bathroom but they were all out on the way to Sin. This was our 1st time travelling business with Singapore and have to say was slightly underwhelmed compared to our other experiences.", "air_title": "Singapore Airlines ", "Customer_name": "J Hampton"}
