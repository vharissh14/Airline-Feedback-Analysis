I had already booked a flight from BKK to SYD on another airline but had to cancel and find another flight closer to my departure date. AirAsia had a business class ticket available departing from Don Mueang at an excellent price, so I bought it. The first flight from DMK to KUL didn't have a designated business class seating section but my seat was in the 3rd row, so that was convenient. The flight from KUL to SYD did have a separate business class seating area, with chairs that reclined almost flat for sleeping. The chair width was ample. Although a 180 degree flatbed would have been better, AirAsia's was decent, and I was able to sleep fairly well. The service was excellent, and we were given extra snack treats. I will definitely fly AirAsia business class for an overnight flight again as long as it is affordable for me.", "air_title": "AirAsia ", "Customer_name": "A Sanford"}
