The AF Prem Econ seats are, as described elsewhere, uncomfortable. They weren't designed for sleep. Our return flight from CDG to JFK was on an Airbus 380. I moved us to the front 2 seats at the emergency exit and we had plenty of room. The toilet kit and 'coronet' were appreciated as well as the wine and cognac. The food was nothing great. I tried to purchase upgraded meals for our return flight but the AF website never seemed to get me there. Check-in was always expedited. All the AF personnel we encountered were friendly and professional.", "air_title": "Air France ", "Customer_name": "M Nye"}
