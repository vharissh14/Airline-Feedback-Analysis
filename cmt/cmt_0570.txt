The difference in quality of aircraft from VIE-DXB, to DXB-HRE was staggering. The Africa-bound plane was old, the seats were narrow and uncomfortable (comparatively), the in- flight entertainment system was archaic (without even the detailed route tracker that is the standard of other Emirates planes). Before opting for the Business class flight, I had flown Emirates coach a number of times and, on the newer planes, it is far superior to business on the Harare route, if value for money is something you care about. Incredibly disappointed. The massive gulf in quality between the Europe-originating route and the Africa-bound one was massive. Unforgivably so, given the fact that we were still expected to pay a premium. Poor showing, Emirates.", "air_title": "Emirates ", "Customer_name": "I Jumbe"}
