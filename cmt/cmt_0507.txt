New planes, on time and very fast, good service. Flight nr. 4 (7h) was with a older A330 and the crew was not so motivated or a bit disorganised. Very slow service. They skipped the first run with drinks and snack and start to serve with the dinner after a while. It took more than 90 minutes to get the first drinks and some food. That flight was a very different experience and not what you expect from a 5 star airline. The new economy seats at the 787 are not very comfortable. hard, narrow and a metal box under the seat.", "air_title": "Qatar Airways ", "Customer_name": "C Meier"}
