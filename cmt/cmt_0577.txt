I would of appreciated more move selection, the same with the music. 25 mins before landing our headphones were collected. Why? Flight attendants were slow bringing drinks. Flight from Brisbane to Dubai (13 hrs) I recalled them coming around with water 4x. I had to get up to ask an attendant to fill my water bottle because they were too busy talking in the food prep area. Meal selection always ran out by the time it got to the back rows. On our final flight the first meal from Dubai to Paris was served 3hrs into the 7hr flight it was breakfast of what was left over and not everything on the menu. Lunch again was what was left over and too salty, I requested cheese and crackers and got told she'd come back after she served the drinks but I got nothing. One of the toilets (Brisbane to Dubai flight) soap dispenser was broken and soap seeped out onto the floor making a huge wet slippery surface. There was never moisturizers or spray in it and there was always one toilet not operational. I paid for a flight that covered all its services why should I be made to feel like my needs are not important. I didn't request extra food or alcohol I just wanted my choices on the menu, toilet paper, soap, spray refreshers and moisturizer in a clean toilet and to be able to listen to good music and get water without having to ask.", "air_title": "Emirates ", "Customer_name": "Mahi Anah"}
