On time take off, so good start. Onboard staff excellent. No wine at all on board. We were in row 2 and we had no choice whatsoever of the meal. One of the items on the menu was not available and one had all gone! No amenity kits and no facility to clean teeth available - after a 9.5 hr flight would think essential.", "air_title": "Kingfisher Airlines ", "Customer_name": "V Jones"}
