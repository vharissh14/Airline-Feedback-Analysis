The flight is operated by AF's subsidairy called HOP. They operate smaller planes, although the Embraer 190 is decent enough. 2x2 seating with reasonable overhead lockers. Seat is adequate (much more leg room than an AF 777 in economy, and probably a little wider) for a 2.5 hours flight. In both cases the crew did the job professionally, although the service in economy is limited to a drink and some biscuits. On return, was upgraded to \"Premium\", which is not much different (same seat), but includes a decent cold light meal and Champagne. Left on time and arrived on time both ways. it seems however that heating / A/C is diffcult to manage on all Embraer 19X planes, every time I take one it is much too hot in the middle, despite crew efforts. Globally a very decent performance. No IFE, but the only competition (SAS) is not better, and you have to buy your drink, and the stewardesses on HOP were much more stylish.", "air_title": "Air France ", "Customer_name": "Marc Guillemard"}
