First time on Qatar. The PHL-DOH flight QR-728 in a 777-300 with bad in-flight entertainment systems. My system (along with many around me) stopped working after about 4 hours into the 12 hr flight. Flight crew promised to \"reset\" my system after completing inflight meal service but never did anything or came back to inform me. After about 2 hours I again informed another flight attendant who \"tried to reset\" with no success. Towards the end of the flight a flight attendant came to me to apologize to say that they have a known technical problem with the system and their engineers will have to look at it in Qatar!", "air_title": "Qatar Airways ", "Customer_name": "S Mendis"}
