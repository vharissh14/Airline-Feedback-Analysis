A380-800 on all legs. I have travelled with Singapore Airlines several times. I think they are on a downward slope. Both trips were on an A380-800(9V-SKK), the inflight entertainment was a little bit old and wasn't a touch screen. The seat pitch is little bit narrow and I'm 175cm. Next, SIA have kept a lot of traditions such as the hot towel service, menu distributed to all classes of passengers etc. Catering quality in SIA is still high, food was freshly prepared, beverages were plentiful, wines and cocktails are never out of stock. Most of the cabin crews provide service with a smile. Overall, a nice trip and good experience.", "air_title": "Singapore Airlines ", "Customer_name": "Zeng Yixie"}
