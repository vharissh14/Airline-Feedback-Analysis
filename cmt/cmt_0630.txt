Whilst the crew were all fantastic and food and drink all good the rest of it was not up to standard at all. This is a very old aircraft with the very old seating and fit out. The business class seats are appalling. The headrest is very proud from the seat back forcing your head forward at an angle so very uncomfortable. The TV screen was very small and on the seatback in front. When the seat in front is reclined your TV screen goes down with it so you end up looking at the floor area just to see the TV and there is a very limited number of films available to watch as well. Worst seat I have ever sat in. My wife's footrest fell into 3 pieces during the flight so not sure what maintenance is done. There is no way that Emirates should be charging full price for this very poor standard.", "air_title": "Emirates ", "Customer_name": "Clive Carter"}
