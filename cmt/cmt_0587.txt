Normally fly Qatar but Emirates were more convenient times so I gave them a go. Overall good but not as good as Qatar. Not impressed with the 380 Business cabin, they've tried to squeeze in too many seats. OK, I'm big but I've never had to ask for a seat extender before in business. Couldn't get the tray fully extended, difficult to sleep as too cramped. Cabin staff excellent but due to size of cabin (over 20 rows) we got our wine after we had finished our food. Food fine. So, much better than BA but some way to go to match Qatar. Airbus 340, DXB-COK and return. Older than 380 but more room, so more comfortable.", "air_title": "Emirates ", "Customer_name": "John Humphey"}
