We found the overall experience to be disappointing and don't understand all the hype about Emirates being one of the best. The seats were narrow and hard which made them very uncomfortable for long flights. Qantas has way better seats. The food was average, nothing to note at all. The biggest disappointment was with the unfriendly, soulless cabin crew on both flights. Barely a smile out of any of them. They looked like they were dead walking, just going through the motions of their jobs. One in fact entertained us by digging around for ear wax a few times and then flicking into the aisle. She was gross! Not at all what we were expecting. Maybe our return flights will be better?", "air_title": "Emirates ", "Customer_name": "G Tucker"}
