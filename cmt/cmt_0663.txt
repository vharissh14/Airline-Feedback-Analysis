Everything 5 star level, boarding with separate F class bus and private suite enables you to join a high level of comfort and privacy. Crew professionalism impressed me, I was always called by name from the Purser. Once seat is converted into a bed it is soft and comfortable. EK F class product is far away from all Europeans and can only compete with LH. Highly recommended.", "air_title": "Emirates ", "Customer_name": "Bertoni Matteo"}
