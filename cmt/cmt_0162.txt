The aircraft an older A330, Seats were not flat, the service acceptable, but not 5 stars. Breakfast was not hot but just lukewarm. For that reason I was not keen in eating it. In my humble opinion that is, the product is totally overpriced, and it selling it on the name only. After the emerging of the middle eastern carriers, you can see the features and benefits other airlines give you. Other airlines talk about. Please don't get me wrong, the airline is acceptable and is better than other airlines, but compared to what you pay and what you get, I am sorry I would not like to buy this product again.", "air_title": "Singapore Airlines ", "Customer_name": "H Ekohl"}
