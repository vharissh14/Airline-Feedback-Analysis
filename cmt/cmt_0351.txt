Flight was scheduled at 7.55pm but was delayed to 8.30pm, most likely due to bad weather. Boarding was fast, seat was extremely narrow and I was rather shocked about it as only recently I flew with MAS. Flight was very bumpy but this is most probably due to weather. Food was rather tasteless and is not worth the price. The ticket price wasn't very cheap either, only about RM20 cheaper than MAS. I would have opted for MAS if MAS has direct flight between these two cities.", "air_title": "AirAsia ", "Customer_name": "Danny Tang"}
