Very good service. Cabin crew were polite and attentive. Helped to find our connecting flight. No inflight entertainment but not an issue as was a very short flight. Seating was 3-3 across but were only the normal economy seats but had middle seat left empty and the armrests could be moved so not impressed by this. Food was very good and well presented. Felt service was what sold this flight to me. When traveling business with other airlines you can see the difference in seating. Liked the flight but would not recommend Air France over other airlines.", "air_title": "Air France ", "Customer_name": "J Leverton"}
