I was excited to fly the A380. However my excitement quickly turned into disappointment after experiencing the absolute crankiness of the cabin crew. Although never really rude the flight stewardesses were all very short and only busy with themselves. Their body language and facial expressions were often as if they'd rather be somewhere else and as if were a constant nuisance. The A380 (AMS-DUB) itself is a very nice plane, spacious and modern. The onboard entertainment was pretty good and the extra touch were the cameras outside the plane so you could watch the outside surroundings from your screen in front of you. The return trip with a 777 was also disappointing. Emirates could not seat us together on the 6 hrs flight despite that we booked under the same booking reference number. Will never fly with them again unless I have no other option.", "air_title": "Emirates ", "Customer_name": "G Nagy"}
