Flight was on a Boeing 777-300. Boarding was on time and it was fast. Take off about 30 minutes late, but even with almost 30 minutes holding time in DXB plane was still on time or schedule. Crew was nice and food choices was matched. I even got a second hot meal as I was still hungry. Bags were on belt when we arrived there. Only downturn was, that the full plane got a remote stand and we had to take the bus to the terminal, which took almost another 30 minutes. Would fly EK again, since the legroom was great in economy.", "air_title": "Emirates ", "Customer_name": "H Mutschler"}
