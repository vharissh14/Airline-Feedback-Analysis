Excellent staffing, food and IFE system. 1st flight automatic upgrade to bulkhead seat, which had so much room! Dream flight. 2nd flight got put on last row windows seat. Nightmarish as so limited room! Plane on 2nd flights both times had severe turbulence, to extent the food- servicing was suspended. Plane was old, had leaking liquid from a baggage door! Nevertheless given amenity pack and offered plenty of drinks etc. Very good experience, especially when I got to Changi airport.", "air_title": "Singapore Airlines ", "Customer_name": "K Cai"}
