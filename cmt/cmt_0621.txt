We used Emirates on all four flights. We were very happy with Emirates, except for our return flight home from Dubai. The service was not what we had previously experienced with the airline. We were some while into our flight when our first meal arrived, clearly there was some delay with this meal, as our next meal arrived within approximately an hour. It all seemed a little chaotic. We appreciate that the cabin crew worked hard and were very busy throughout the flight, however during the other three flights in a two week period the service was excellent. We have flown with Emirates before and have received very good service so we're disappointed.", "air_title": "Emirates ", "Customer_name": "Susan Woodyatt"}
