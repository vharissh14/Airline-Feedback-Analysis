I was upgraded to Gold membership with their frequent flyer program. I thought I would upgrade with my miles. It is not possible to upgrade on both legs of the LHR-DEL route. The return leg (a day flight) is possible, but not the outbound (a night flight). There seem to be no male flight crew at all. The seats work and are comfortable, the food is fine and the staff work hard and do their best. The stewardesses are lovely, but I am going to spend my miles and switch to an alternative.", "air_title": "Kingfisher Airlines ", "Customer_name": "Steve Splowski"}
