The flights to Dubai and then Istanbul were fairly uneventful. I had requested a gluten free meal. The gluten free portion of the meal was unimaginative and very unappetising. Arriving at Istanbul we waited at least 30 minutes for the luggage to be offloaded. The return trip, however, was an ordeal from beginning to end. The flight left Istanbul more than an hour late. We had to wait in a boarding area that was far too small for the number of passengers. We arrived in Dubai with 30 minutes to make our connecting flight and were told that we had been rescheduled on a later flight, which meant a wait of 5 hours through the night. Our compensation was an inadequate meal voucher. Meanwhile, our original connection left more than 30 minutes late in any case and we could still have made it. The new connection also left late by about 40 minutes. My special meal request was not transferred to the new flight. The flight was jam packed and the service was patchy. When the coffee eventually came around it was absolutely cold. I will not be flying Emirates again.", "air_title": "Emirates ", "Customer_name": "C Lewis"}
