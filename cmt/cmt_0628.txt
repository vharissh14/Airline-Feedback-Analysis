Boeing777-300 and Airbus A380 aircraft respectively. Emirates disappointed this time, my DFW-DXB-BOM service was better with respect to food especially. Seats were fine and comfortable on A380. Dubai Mumbai services are served with old aircraft's so nothing special about the small flight. DXB-DFW flight starts at 2.45 am and the timings of the meals are not proper in my opinion. They serve breakfast within an hour of takeoff (Who wants breakfast at 3.45 am). They should just serve a light snack at that time and then serve breakfast 4-5 hours after takeoff and then lunch after 4-5 hours of the breakfast. I didn't like the timings of the meal. They also ran out of lunch options and I had to take what was available. Overall, was disappointed with Emirates' service.", "air_title": "Emirates ", "Customer_name": "Haider Hazrat"}
