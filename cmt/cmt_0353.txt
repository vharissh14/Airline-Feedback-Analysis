The fares were excellent and the planes, neat and clean. The price is the Company's UPS, which is helping them do well in Malaysia, Indonesia and other Asian countries, where they fly. The only thing which I did not like, was issuing Paper Boarding passes, instead of the regular passes. But I heard they have changed this and are now issuing the normal passes. Would surely fly again.", "air_title": "AirAsia ", "Customer_name": "Rajesh V Baliga"}
