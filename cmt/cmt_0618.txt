Going out OK but remember much longer journey than with other airlines, you also have to change planes. Service in past has made this acceptable, not any more will I be doing it. Earphones were not working so entertainment not good going out on one half of outward journey. Return journey was a nightmare. Plane full and a seat in front that came so far back, I had trouble opening my tray. The guy in front watched movies all the way but was not concerned that I had no room. Monitor did not work for three hours, so they reset it three times before it worked. Seatbelt was falling apart. Toilet had no water in sink after putting soap on hands. Water dispenser also was not working. Second meal before landing not served. I was already unhappy from first leg. Second flight was from the other side of the airport, a good thirty minutes dash, never had such a distance on such a tiring journey. Dubai to Manchester now another eight hours if you are lucky. Problems with a forty ton machine being loaded in cargo hold, falls off pallets and jams luggage hold. We sit in our seats for two hours waiting to take off. We eventually do set off. Leave aircraft and immediately complain on website. No answer as yet. I have travelled with Emirates over the years many times, I will not be doing so again, service is no longer there.", "air_title": "Emirates ", "Customer_name": "M Green"}
