The AirAsia counters were grossly under staffed with 2 to 3 staff members frantically trying to process up to 4 or 5 flights of passengers. There was not enough staff to manage the queue, many passengers were fed up and started queue jumping. Many passengers were late to board the plane, not to mention time to shop the DFS stores. My flight to Bali took off an hour late. Worst experience I had with a budget airline.", "air_title": "AirAsia ", "Customer_name": "Sia Lian Huat"}
