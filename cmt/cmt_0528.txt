The service both on land and in flight was exceptional!!!! The food and food presentation was first class! A pure joy in relation to other airlines we have flown. The air stewards were always willing to help, well dressed and had a good attitude at all times. There is ample leg room, even with the entertainment box, if there was one at our feet. If you wish to fly Qatar, please take a converter for your personal headphones as theirs is a 2 prong. We had a 24 hour lay over in Doha. Qatar Airways granted us an accommodation and food voucher. Our stay in Doha was wonderful and memorable. It is an easy process at Hamad Airport to get the vouchers and board the shuttle to the relevant hotel. I was anxious about this period, but it was an easy stay over. My husband and I highly recommend Qatar Airways.", "air_title": "Qatar Airways ", "Customer_name": "Anderson Leigh-Anne"}
