Flew Economy but bagged the two seat row at the rear of the 777. That allowed us to walk about without disturbing fellow passengers. Good leg room. Comfortable seating. Food good with additional snacks en route. Plenty of wine, soft drinks and beer. Great crew and adequate entertainment. Departed CDG a little late but made up time to land Havana more or less on time. Return journey not so good. aircraft booked solid. Had no choice of seat. Food not very good due to supposed catering issue in Havana and departed 3 hours late. That decided it for us, next time upgrade to business even if we have to pay more.", "air_title": "Air France ", "Customer_name": "A Hardman"}
