Must take EK again for the flight to Bangkok due to the best price base on 6 months advance booking. FRA-DXB on A380 nice aircraft-flight full, but still roomy DXB-BKK on B777 did not get the selected seats (even those seats are selected 6 months in advance by the time of booking on EK Tool) EK has changed our seats and we did not sit together/flight full - no more to say about the 3-4-3 seating. Worst service of all sectors, slow service, we requested water but were told to wait for the next service. BKK-DXB-FRA on A380/B777 flight full, our choice of foods ran out on every sector. I've flown Emirates over a period of six years and I can definitively say that every time I fly, the service is getting worse. Its route networks and frequencies are very good and its fares (if booking at least 3 months in advance) can be competitive. However EK progressively gets worse. EK is still on cutting back massively on quality, example no amenity kits for Y class, foods (quality and quantity) is getting worse, cutting the Skywards-mileage counts, too small number of cabin crews in Y cabin and they are disinterested in passenger service, avoid service to passengers, disregards the calling sign. Very chaotic and very slow on board-services, choice of foods ran out very early, no organization. All those bad on board services EK fare is no more valuable for money. Only IFE is the best.", "air_title": "Emirates ", "Customer_name": "Manootham Steven"}
