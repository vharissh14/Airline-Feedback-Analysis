At about 10.30am we were told the flight would leave 2.5 hours late. (We didn't board until after 3pm). Many of us would miss connecting flights, I was told that I would be informed about my new connection in Kuala Lumpur. We arrived just after 9pm, we handed our boarding passes and were told to wait. After an hour, we were given boarding passes for our next flights and were told we had to collect our baggage to go to a hotel. We waited for an hour with our luggage, then went through immigration and customs, and left the airport to wait for a bus to our hotel. After midnight, some of us started to realise that the promised hotel rooms were non-existent, and went inside to be in the air conditioning. (We hadn't had food or water served for about five hours by this time.) One staff member yelled at people who were reluctant to leave again to wait for the hotel bus, and security were called when one passenger started to complain loudly. A group of passengers were taken to a hotel and returned to our group outside the airport after an hour because they couldn't get them rooms. AirAsia staff then left us. I, for example, waited 12 hours outside the airport with all my luggage; I had no Malaysian currency to buy food because I was only in transit. No one offered me a food or drink voucher, and not one AirAsia staff member apologised. Apparently this level of service is acceptable. I would never book with them again as it's a false economy: you might save a few dollars upfront but if something goes wrong, AirAsia takes no corporate responsibility and you are on your own.", "air_title": "AirAsia ", "Customer_name": "Karen Dean"}
