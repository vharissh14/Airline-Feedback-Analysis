The first leg had good service, light meal with tasty food. Entertainment with small touch screen, several movies and medium selection of music. On the second leg I flew with the new A380-800, a very nice and spacious plane, more legroom, large touchscreen, a huge number of movies, music, games. Disappointed by only one meal, also not very tasty (chicken changee). Back from BKK to BUD with the same type of airplanes, this time two meals from BKK to DXB. All flights in time, polite staff and good service.", "air_title": "Emirates ", "Customer_name": "H Jung"}
