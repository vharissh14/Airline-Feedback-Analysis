The worst flying experience. Five Emirates flights and all of them delayed! On two of the flights home they failed to serve two meals they even had the gall to state \"due to inclement weather economy meals will not be served\" OK if you were business or first, but economy, forget it! On the last flight back from Bangkok to Dubai, the flight was late arriving, we were met by Emirates staff who said our flight was being held for seven of us. We were rushed through Dubai airport (very large airport and some of us had ailments) no transport arranged. When we reached the departure gate the staff there told us \"its too late for you to get on, we did tell arrivals this!\" We were then directed from desk to desk to make arrangements for another flight, five desks in all we were sent too in all corners of Dubai airport. We managed to book flights later in the day and they offered us their hotel to shower etc. This meant another group around Dubai airport to get back through customs and to find the bus. We asked if we could just use the airport lounge due to the people suffering from all the walking and we were told \"you cannot use the lounge that is for business and first class only\". By the time we reached the hotel we just had time to shower, eat a late breakfast and back to the airport to go through customs and immigration again. Emirates could not have made us feel any worse with there attitude and behaviour. Our advise to you if you are travelling economy is to go for another airline, we have traveled on China Eastern and found the service much better than Emirates provide.", "air_title": "Emirates ", "Customer_name": "Langsford Michael"}
