Having flown dozens of times in SE Asia, and might we add that we always fly Business Class for our long haul with another airline, we find Air Asia short flights excellent. If you choose to fly long haul on a budget airline don't expect first class service. Air Asia does what it says on the tin. They are punctual, good value food, wed upgrade our luggage and seat when you book and crew are always pleasant. Petty comments about no entertainment on a 1 or 2 hour flight takes some beating. As with Ryanair follow their rules and you will have no problems.", "air_title": "AirAsia ", "Customer_name": "B Stokes"}
