I flew with my wife and 4-year-old son from Jakarta to Singapore on 12 Sep 2014. Surprisingly, three of us were assigned to three different seats in three different rows. I asked the check-in counter officer to change the seats. However, he said that the flight was full and suggested I purchase seats in advance on my next flights. Some thoughts on this incident: 1) Is this Air Asia business model? Separating a toddler from his/her parents could PUSH the parents to purchase seats on the next flight. This is shown as an ads on AirAsia magazine. 2) Is safety Air Asia's concern? Separating a toddler from his/her parents raises a safety risk. Suppose an emergency event occurs. Who will help the toddler? Do you think a stranger sitting next to him/her would help him/her? Finally, I exchanged seats with other passengers. This definitely causes unpleasant for them. After this incident, I do not recommend a family with young children to fly with Air Asia unless they want to purchase seats.", "air_title": "AirAsia ", "Customer_name": "Erwin Leonardi"}
