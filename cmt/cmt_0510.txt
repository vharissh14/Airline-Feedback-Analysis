Both legs on A320 aircraft. The newer aircraft on the first leg provided softer seating and entertainment on demand, while the older A320 on the second leg had harder seating and no entertainment. Legroom is an issue because of the entertainment box under the seat in front of you (F seats) but otherwise okay. Recline is generous even though people behind you complain that it invades their space.", "air_title": "Qatar Airways ", "Customer_name": "M Verri"}
