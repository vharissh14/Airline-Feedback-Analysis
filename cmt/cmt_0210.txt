Would not use this airline again, nor would I recommend travelling with Singapore Airlines. The seating was uncomfortable and cramped, extremely poor inflight entertainment, the food was an ice cream dessert that was still frozen and inedible. One of the meals contained pork so tough I could not cut through it. Another meal that was supposed to be beef just consisted mainly of gristle. The only good part of all four flights was that most of the cabin staff were efficient and helpful. I found the whole experience extremely disappointing, and certainly poor value for money.", "air_title": "Singapore Airlines ", "Customer_name": "C Dickinson"}
