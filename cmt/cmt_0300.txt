Their cabin crew are friendly and always smiling, the meals were excellent, the seat was huge and IFE was excellent. The lounge in Singapore was the best I have been in. For the 25 hours it took to get from Sydney to Paris I enjoyed every second, what I liked the most was the express passes at Sydney International Airport skipping the queue at customs. I don't usually fly on business trips with the kids but they loved it too!", "air_title": "Singapore Airlines ", "Customer_name": "B Smith"}
