On arrival at Dubai no one met the passengers to offer directions to desks etc, and on asking to use the lounge to send an email, was met with a 'no' - not every one has a fancy phone with internet service! Hotel voucher, led to a hotel room for a 'sleep' of approx 3hrs, not worth the effort. For the cost of the ticket, was not impressed with the lack of ground service or apologies for such a long delay one would think they would be more organised as this must happen regularly.", "air_title": "Emirates ", "Customer_name": "M Ness"}
