Despite a full flight, service was good. Flight steward were attended to fulfil my request very soon after the bell was pressed. But disappointed over the ageing aircraft. SQ ticket price definitely not in the lower bracket, but the 777-300 cabinet condition and facilities were just too old when comparing to other carriers.", "air_title": "Singapore Airlines ", "Customer_name": "J Wong"}
