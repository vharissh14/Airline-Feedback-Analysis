In general the service was good, and we all enjoyed the food very much. There was a problem on the route from Singapore to Brisbane, in that our seats were in the centre block, and for some reason the crew kept missing us, first we got no food (they ran out just as they got to us, then started serving people around us, but not us) and in spite of several attempts to get their attention, they ignored us. Eventually my husband had to go down and ask them for food. The stewardess was very apologetic. I also noticed that when seatbelt checks were done on that flight, they didn't actually look along our row. I witnessed a couple of people pressing the Call button, and getting no response, at least for quite a while. On the same flight the entertainment monitors were unreliable. Mine didn't have sound for a while, and my son's just stopped working. The other legs of our journey were quite good, and I was impressed that our luggage reached our final destination efficiently. I did find the legroom a bit cramped, but that was more to do with the pillows and blankets. The main problem on the final leg of our return journey was a child a couple of rows behind us that just cried incessantly for almost 16 hours. Being a night flight, we'd hoped to sleep most of the way, but the whole section of the plane around the child was kept awake. There seemed to be no bassinets on our flight, so no doubt the child had to try to get comfortable sitting on parents lap? The crew were no doubt also affected by the crying, but what can anyone do in such a situation?", "air_title": "Singapore Airlines ", "Customer_name": "A Genner"}
