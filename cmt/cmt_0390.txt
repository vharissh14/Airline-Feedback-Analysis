The flight was on a budget fare but was on-time at all stops. Food on board had to purchased but quite reasonable. Customs clearance at Bangkok Don Mueang was also efficient. On the return journey in August my wallet was stolen at Don Mueang and Airasia held the plane for 20 minutes while their staff assisted with a search. As my wallet was not located, I was without cash when I arrived at Kuala Lumpur. I was very impressed when one of their staff gave me 20 ringgits so I could purchase a meal. Most impressive.", "air_title": "AirAsia ", "Customer_name": "Geoffrey Hudson"}
