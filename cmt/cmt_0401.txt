While in Rome I was emailed that Air Asia cancelled 2 of our segments and replaced them with another 2. The first was only an hour delay so no big deal. However, the second one put us into SGN too late to make our connecting flight on to DAD. As soon as we landed in BKK I went to the Air Asia help desk and explained my problem. BTW, This is a Thai Air Asia flight. The 2 young staff members couldn't have helped me more. They understood my problem and did a great job fixing it. I've flown them several times and they're a first class low fare carrier. When they charge you for food and drinks on board, it's at a reasonable amount. They now only operate out of Don Muang (DMK) but there is a free shuttle between DMK and BKK airport. Great airline, great crew, in the air and on the ground.", "air_title": "AirAsia ", "Customer_name": "Robert McElroy-Lawrence"}
