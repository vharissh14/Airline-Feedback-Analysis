QZ547 and QZ 544. My husband and I travelled on Air Asia Perth to Denpasar return last week and the flights were fine. The Perth to Denpasar flight left 30 minutes early and as it wasn't a full flight my husband was able to stretch out and have a sleep. The Denpasar to Perth flight was full but once again there were no issues. The flight attendants did their jobs competently. I would definitely recommend Air Asia for short trips.", "air_title": "AirAsia ", "Customer_name": "Adriansz Allison"}
