The flight was virtually empty so I just got up and opened up all the blinds that the cabin crew had shut so that I could see out and enjoy the spectacular views of Mt Ararat, amongst other things. I too wondered why on earth the cabin staff were making us think we were flying at night and I found it very irritating, sufficiently so that I would hesitate to fly this airline again, notably as neither the seat comfort, not the staff service, nor the food, nor the inflight entertainment were particularly noteworthy.", "air_title": "Qatar Airways ", "Customer_name": "C Mackenzie"}
