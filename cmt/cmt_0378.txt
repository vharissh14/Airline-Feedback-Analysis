Happy with their efficient and no-nonsense service. Baggage went all the way from KCH to ICN. Flight departed on time (as with most other flights I have taken with AirAsia). In-flight magazine was quite an interesting and informative read. Pleased with the courtesy of the crew. Also the Captain greeted disembarking passengers which is excellent.", "air_title": "AirAsia ", "Customer_name": "Yihwei Law"}
