We were overall very disappointed with the quality of the service and the staff attitude onboard. Air hostesses were rude, staff made us wait for our hot meals as we refused a menu we had not requested, on the way back special meals were not edible! T3 in Dubai is unpleasant and not set up to host so many people and planes (30 min bus journey from the plane to the terminal).", "air_title": "Emirates ", "Customer_name": "R Solenn"}
