Flow with the new 787 Dreamliner, and as many have written here, the seats are quite bad. Really disappointing, since I had higher expectations on Qatar Airways. The seats are small, legroom is tight and the IFE-box takes up to much space. The entertainment-system is good, food and service is also good. Also flew with their A330, which is more comfortable but the entertainment system is really old now. Their best airplanes are without doubt the Boeing 777, which is both comfortable and modern. That's the plane I recommend if you travel with Qatar Airways. But for me, I will choose another carrier next time.", "air_title": "Qatar Airways ", "Customer_name": "A Arman"}
