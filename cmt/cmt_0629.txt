A380 in business. As usual lounges both ends were luxurious, spacious and comfortable. There is no doubt that the window seats on the upper deck are absolutely fantastic. Big screen TV, private and comfortable. Outbound to Auckland the service was very slow and I only ate breakfast 20 minutes before descent. On the return flight no such problems. The bar is a nice touch and usable unlike similar products on 777's. The quietness of the 380 is unbelievable especially for travellers like me that cut there teeth on DC8's and 707's.", "air_title": "Emirates ", "Customer_name": "S Avant"}
