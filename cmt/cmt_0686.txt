Travelling from Dubai to New York on the A380, I bought paid for the WiFi access and used it for about 5 minutes before it went off. When I complained to the onboard service director, she told me that Emirates was not responsible for the service and that I needed to write to \"inner\" the service provider. This was absolutely shocking - in my opinion, Emirates is responsible for every service offered on it's flights. Also, flying from LHR to Dubai, on a night flight, my seat was damaged and wouldn't recline so having paid for a first class seat, I was unable to get a nights rest (the aircrew told me that they knew the seat was damaged before the flight left but that the engineer was unable to fix it). The flight was full so I was unable to be relocated but I would have preferred to have been given the choice of another flight - this is what Qantas would have done. Put simply, I believe that Emirates have placed far too much emphasis on growth and not enough on keeping customers happy. Given the available alternatives and the cost of air tickets, I for one will not be flying Emirates anymore.", "air_title": "Emirates ", "Customer_name": "G Tolefe"}
