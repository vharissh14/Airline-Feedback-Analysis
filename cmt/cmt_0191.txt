Older 777. Good seats. IFE still bad but everything else good on to Rome to Singapore leg. The Singapore to Perth leg was not what you would expect from Singapore Airlines. The crew were really rushing everything. Not sure why as it was 5 hour flight. It looked like they had trainees on board and the older crew were exerting their authority. The cabin crew were almost running between points on the plane. The coffee service was with the meal and the jug was flayed around with speed and not much care. There was no respite, this sort of rush continued all the way to landing. I am sure this is an isolated incident, I will still fly with them though.", "air_title": "Singapore Airlines ", "Customer_name": "B Glover"}
