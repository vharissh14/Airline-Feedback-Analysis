CDG is a pretty poor airport in comparison with other European hubs. Flight to PTY departed from terminal 2E. 777-200 was quite old, but well maintained. 3x4x3 seating does make your seat very narrow, but pitch wasn't too bad. Worst thing was the IFE, like something from the late 90's, choice was minimal, and screen quality awful. Food and service was good (champagne, cognac and ice cream all offered), but crew quickly vanished once the first meal was served, although the self service trolley's are a great idea and encourages you to get up and stretch your legs.", "air_title": "Air France ", "Customer_name": "Hannibal Matt"}
