This was a great flight. Gracious and charming service on a 7 year old 777-200 in the old configuration with comfy armchair style recliners. Delicious beef steak, with great red wine and champagne. The cabin crew were professional and friendly. The IFE was very old fashioned, but that was the only demerit, otherwise excellent.", "air_title": "Singapore Airlines ", "Customer_name": "Raoul Dasilva"}
