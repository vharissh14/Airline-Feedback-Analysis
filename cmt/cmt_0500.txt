As this is a day flight leaving at 7.30am, which is why we booked it, does anyone know why every single window blind was put in to blackout mode after breakfast was served (not done by the passengers) and the cabin lights dimmed? Stayed this way throughout flight, couldn't even see what the FA was serving us unless you put reading light on. If I wanted the ambience of a night flight I would have booked one! Just wondered if it is Qatar Airways policy to do this even on daytime flights. We were in economy 12 E & F. More legroom on short haul 737s, very cramped, very disappointed passenger!", "air_title": "Qatar Airways ", "Customer_name": "Alison Swain"}
