The SQ232 flight was outstanding. Very efficient crew with turnaround time for bell call being less than a minute. It was a rather smooth ride, food excellent and good entertainment selection. SQ118 was a short flight of 45 minutes but again crew was excellent and proved why its still one of the best.", "air_title": "Singapore Airlines ", "Customer_name": "Karamdeep Singh Satwant Singh"}
