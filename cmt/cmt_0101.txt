The long-haul BOG-CDG was terrible. The A-340-300 was not as tidy as one could expect, and IFE was deplorable. I couldn't watch movies because anytime I pressed the obsolete screen it would appear \"veuillez patienter\". On top of that, this flight had a 45 minute delay, so I lost my connection to AMS. Fortunately, ground staff at CDG were polite and booked me another flight later that day and provided me a 20-euro meal voucher. CDG-AMS was nothing special, FAs were quick and not-so-kind at serving snacks and beverages. My return flight was in Premium Economy and things really improved here. FAs were extremely kind and smiling. However, I waited more than 40 minutes for my bag, even though I had a priority sticker. Conclusion of this review: Don't fly Air France if your travelling Economy. Choose it if you book Premium.", "air_title": "Air France ", "Customer_name": "J Duran"}
