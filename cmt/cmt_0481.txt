First flight was with their new Boeing 787 - Dreamliner. Good entertainment system, high resolution screen, but slow response in the touch and a lack of music and TV-series. The seat config is not good however, the leg-room is a bit disappointing. Otherwise, the Dreamliner is a nice airplane. On the way back it was with the A330, which is getting old and they should really change the entertainment system onboard. It didn't even work, so the flight back was quite boring. Had a short flight with their B777 also from Doha to Dubai, which is probably the best airplane Qatar has got right now. More legroom, good entertainment system and so on.", "air_title": "Qatar Airways ", "Customer_name": "Ari Ayam"}
