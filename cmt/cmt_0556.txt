Got on board and after an hour informed that the overhead lights don't work and that the crew had informed ground personnel about the problem before push back, but that nothing could be done. I would have appreciated being informed by the crew when they introduced themselves that there was a problem with the overhead lights, particularly given that it is a daytime 14-hour flights when some passengers may wish to work. Service on board was good. Food was very good, well presented and prepared and very tasty. Flight departed on time. Check in easy with lots of staff to greet and provide directions. Overall a good product at a competitive fare for business class from the US to the Gulf States.", "air_title": "Qatar Airways ", "Customer_name": "M LaPrairie"}
