The long hauls were on barely two years old 777-300s. We found the shell seats more than adequate for Y+ (though we are both tall), bearing in mind the very (!) reasonable fare compared to C. Flight attendants were impeccable - attentive, all smiles, efficient, present at all times - and more than happy to converse in a variety of languages other than French (including German). Food and drinks were plenty, well presented and of high quality. For those who like in-flight entertainment, there was an abundance to choose from, including lots of music, and screens of decent size. As a nice add-on, AF Y+ gives you some extra services (\"sky priority\", i.e. quicker check in, customer services and boarding, and fast lane access at security / immigration), which are particularly useful at CDG. All in all very pleasant, great value for money, and definitely recommendable.", "air_title": "Air France ", "Customer_name": "J C Eggers"}
