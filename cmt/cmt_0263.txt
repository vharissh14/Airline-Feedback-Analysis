Can't believe Singapore still use this aircraft, it desperately needs an overhaul, tiny 6 inch displays, no touch, even with full brightness I was struggling, switched to using my tablet instead. Seat rests do go fully up. Service was poor this time around, Food normally in economy is ok to good, this wasn't. Not a nice way to come back to NZ. will consider other options.", "air_title": "Singapore Airlines ", "Customer_name": "Alan Ford"}
