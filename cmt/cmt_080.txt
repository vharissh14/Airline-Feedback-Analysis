Flying Bangkok-CDG-Prague and return. It was and is quite annoying that Air France offers online check in, however has all seats (apart from some mid aisle) blocked and you are unable to choose or plan, all AF is trying to push is seats with more legroom, but many fail to realise that these are just by the lavatories and kitchens, thus very uncomfortable (lights, crowded and many just stand there to stretch). Actual check-in in Bangkok painless and quick, the flight was operated by a brand new 777-300, quite tasty food and acceptable entertainment. The whole flight could have been a great one but there has been ZERO cabin crew presence for a 12 hrs flight. Food was delivered fast and it was collected even faster and then no one was to be found. Absolutely speechless when a crew actually refused to bring drinks for a family with kids commenting that there is a bar at the rear galley (the one they failed to announce so few people knew). Return flight uneventful (with much older plane with visibly less comfort and legroom and ancient useless entertainment) and surprised that the transit in CDG was all right except having 20+ passport control booths and only 1 serviced! Flights on time and baggage unharmed. All in all a very standard flight but if having a choice I would go with other airlines who offer a bit more value for money and attention.", "air_title": "Air France ", "Customer_name": "Farouk Mogheth"}
