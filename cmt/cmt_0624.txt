Flight entertainment system excellent but wifi connection was very limited. Flights on A300 to and from COL to DXB also very comfortable, cabin crew generally friendly and efficient. Emirates really need to think about enforcing their hand baggage policy, we saw people being allowed to take oversized bags on and also more than the one bag permitted (one person boarding from DXB to COL had four bags! This means that people getting on the plane further down the queue have nowhere to put their hand baggage.", "air_title": "Emirates ", "Customer_name": "Ken Wilkins"}
