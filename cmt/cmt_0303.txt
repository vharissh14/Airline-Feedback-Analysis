Today returned from my short Easter vacation with a round trip Pune-Mumbai- Singapore in Business class on 421 and 422. Spacious seats with extendable leg space for sleeping. Excellent Service - offered blankets and head rest within minutes. They serve the best inflight fresh food. You must not miss their 'Book the Cook' option and their speciality is the delicious Lobster Thermidor. Staff pronounced my difficult name correctly and the stewardess offered to fill in my landing visa form, my luggage was already towed in advance to my waiting car so I wont have to wait at the terminal after my flight.", "air_title": "Singapore Airlines ", "Customer_name": "U Ashwathy"}
