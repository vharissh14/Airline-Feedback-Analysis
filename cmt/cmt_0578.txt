Crews are friendly, courteous. I wonder why these crews are not deployed on the long haul route such as LAX, even on Business Class of the same route, need crews like this set to work on. For example, there was a crying infant, who tirelessly screamed pretty much the entire flight, much to the annoyance of many passengers. One of the crew offered the mother to look after the screaming child, although not taken by the offered customer, her kindness and customer orientation is surely noticed by other passengers. Food on this route is enjoyable, Asian style chicken. Got upgraded to Business on the first leg, which is very nice of Emirates to recognize my status with them. Seat is a bit hard on the A380, however, bearable on a short and medium haul flight. I can not imagine sitting in that seat for a long haul 16 hours flight to LAX.", "air_title": "Emirates ", "Customer_name": "Martin D Hiu"}
