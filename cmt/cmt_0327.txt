I had heard positive things about Singapore Airlines, but to be honest I was quite disappointed. The service was better than rival airlines but was not fantastic. At least they did offer drinks at frequent intervals. The seats were uncomfortable and the cabin temperature was cold. On the outgoing Singapore/Sydney sector it was really far too cold. The food was absolutely awful. I ordered a vegetarian meal and, except for the meal out of Sydney, it was virtually inedible. If you have a nut allergy don't fly with this airline as packets of nuts are given out freely. I'm not sure if I would fly with SA again.", "air_title": "Singapore Airlines ", "Customer_name": "D Thomas"}
