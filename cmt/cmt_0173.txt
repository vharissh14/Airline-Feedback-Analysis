All four sectors were on the A380, and I had economy seating on the main deck for two trips and on the upper deck for the other two. Smoothest take-offs I have experienced and smooth, quiet flights in general. Excellent service from flight attendants who treat you like they want you to fly with them again. They would come back and check on people who had questions or didn't understand how to operate the entertainment system. Adequate legroom and very good entertainment system to help you pass the hours. Most meals were excellent, and flight attendants came through at non-serving times to offer snack items. Only minor issues: the entertainment system would lag a bit on playback of films, and the tray table/seating areas could use a bit of a deep clean. Otherwise, this was the first time I had flown Singapore Airlines in nearly five years and it remains as good as I remember - my favourite airline. Highly recommended.", "air_title": "Singapore Airlines ", "Customer_name": "Thomas Lundberg"}
