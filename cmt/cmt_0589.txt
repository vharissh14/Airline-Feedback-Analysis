I have never had an issue until my last flight from Manila to the UK. Arriving at Manila for check in found that the flight was overbooked and Emirates were asking for volunteers to give up their seat. As a Silver member I was advised that I would be upgraded to business class for the MNL-DXB leg of the journey, and all seemed well. The service on this leg was great, meals were excellent and the business class cabin was roomy and comfortable. The only downside with this flight the entertainment system which wasn't working in Business class for most of the flight. The second leg from DXB to LGW was in economy class and this version of the 777 was very cramped, much more cramped than previous Emirates 777 flights. Service was good though when trolley service was completed they struck the arm rest with the trolley breaking the headset plug leaving the prongs embedded in the socket. This resulted in the rest of the flight with no sound for entertainment system. Arriving in London found that there were issues with my baggage.", "air_title": "Emirates ", "Customer_name": "S Fletcher"}
