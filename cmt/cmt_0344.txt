Everything about the flights was completely satisfactory and simply no fault could be found. I have no hesitation in recommending them. It's a pity such airlines based in the UK / Europe do not seem to operate at this level. Food and inflight entertainment not used. Only included as one star as the system demands it must be answered.", "air_title": "AirAsia ", "Customer_name": "T Harvey"}
