This is the second time I have flown Qatar and again was very pleased with the result. All check in staff courteous and helpful. Cabin staff very helpful. Food was simple but very good. Seat was particularly wide for Economy 18.9 inches I think and legroom and recline good. I never sleep well but the cabin and seating gave me the best chance it could in a fairly crowded economy class. Excellent value for money if you can get one of their promotional fares but good anyway.", "air_title": "Qatar Airways ", "Customer_name": "G Walbrook"}
