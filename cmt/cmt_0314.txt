Both were on the B777-300ER series. Adequate legroom, and good IFE to keep me entertained throughout the flight. As usual, the service was up to standard, professional and efficient, but Singapore Airlines service tends to lag the warmth and personable service despite being efficient and professional. That being said, a worthwhile flight on both leg under Singapore Airlines and I will recommend to choose Singapore Airline compared to Emirates for this route.", "air_title": "Singapore Airlines ", "Customer_name": "Wilson See"}
