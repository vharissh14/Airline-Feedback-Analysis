The flight, a Boeing 777-300ER, was on time, clean and very comfortable, the crew was very welcoming and friendly. The meal was excellent (I have chosen Air France special meal \"Lenotre\") and the entertainment very rich - with French and international programmes. This 8 hour flight was a great experience!", "air_title": "Air France ", "Customer_name": "F Bernard"}
