Check-in staff were rude and ignorant, we were left at the service desks for almost 30 mins unattended. The inflight entertainment did not work for the middle of the cabin. The toilets were not kept clean. We were travelling with a 10 month infant and there was no bassinet or seatbelt provided. Seats were uncomfortable and 5 out of the 6 seats we booked had some type of fault in it (cup holder broken, remote broken etc).", "air_title": "Kingfisher Airlines ", "Customer_name": "Sonia Mitchells"}
