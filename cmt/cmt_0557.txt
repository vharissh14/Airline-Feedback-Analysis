A330 not as good as the 777, and feared the angled flat seat and then had the best night's sleep I've had on a plane! Best flight of the lot for service and food. A320, CMB-DOH with a regional business class seat for 5.5 hour flight, worst flight of the 4 despite a lovely crew. Just not a suitable seat for that length of flight - the 2 other flights from CMB are A330 and 777 with a \"proper\" business class seat. I wouldn't do this flight again, but it did work with the schedule I needed. Delayed and therefore missed my connection in DOH as India closed it's airspace due to a missile test. Not Qatar's fault, and very well handled, was re-booked before I checked in on to the later LHR flight. A319 all business class. Comfortable seat, OK food, not a great crew, overly attentive again, and far too many announcements. Felt claustrophobic in such a small plane for a 8 hour flight. Suggest QR get a widebody on that flight and make some more money with economy passengers and cargo - would be better for everyone! Overall, not a bad experience, a good price, and I would fly QR if the price and schedule worked.", "air_title": "Qatar Airways ", "Customer_name": "M Knowlden"}
