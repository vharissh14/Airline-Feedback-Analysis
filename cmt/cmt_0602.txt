On all of our paperwork we had numbered seats together. We actually sat in these seats on the first flight and never sat together again. After 3 days in Dubai we arrived at the airport after midnight to find that there were no seats on the plane, so ours had been sold to someone else. We waited to see if there would be seats as we had a connection waiting for us in Colombo. Desk was hopelessly undermanned and after a long wait, no seats available anywhere on the plane. After 20 minutes or so it was clear there wasn't a hotel to go to either so spent an uncomfortable night in a cold Dubai airport with a voucher for probably the cheapest meal in the cafe. Got on the next plane in the morning which was delayed by an hour. We did get a voucher to travel from Dubai to Colombo! How this airline has built a reputation for being one of top carriers is beyond us. The only thing that was better than the cheapest airlines was the entertainment system but no way can this make up for the rest of our experience. We did write to express how we thought that our experience should be giving real cause for concern to customer relations. Never got a reply.", "air_title": "Emirates ", "Customer_name": "S Millard"}
