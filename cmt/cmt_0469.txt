Felt like being in a swanky hotel rather than a lounge. On-board, the seats were fine not as nice as Emirates but for sure a comfy space. Great food and beverage service, little tip they leave the Krug at the bar, worth the walk over! IFE was a bit skippy. DOH-RHY on 787, they used Business but rebrand it as first Short trip so fine - not a major fan of the 787. The lounge in Riyadh is abysmal but it's shared. Spent time in duty free to avoid this lounge. Doha terminal nice, easy to have a long layover especially here with the family rooms available for a sleep and Krug on Tap. Don't recommend the 45 min transfer, the terminal is big and there is no help on connections to get you there on time - at least they let business out as priority so I had a chance and the run woke me up a little bit. DOH-LHR was on the Business One A319 aircraft. Comfortable Seats, IFE didn't work properly (kept skipping again but more frequently) but as they handed out PJ's it encouraged everyone to go to sleep. Service on both legs excellent.", "air_title": "Qatar Airways ", "Customer_name": "K Coutinho"}
