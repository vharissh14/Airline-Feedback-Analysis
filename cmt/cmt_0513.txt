Worst seating I have encountered in economy. Not only are the seats very narrow but some design genius who has never flown economy thought it would be a good feature to locate a large IFE box under the seat so one leg will always be constantly rubbing against it. When the seat in front is reclined there is no room to move so the people in the window or middle seat are trapped. Service was ok but choice of movies not as extensive as Emirates.", "air_title": "Qatar Airways ", "Customer_name": "C McLuckie"}
