The A380 was excellent as it's a brand new aircraft with new comfy seats and more legroom. Also, the crew provides excellent service for my family. Food was pretty decent, but the IFE could be improved. The return leg was an old 777-200ER. The service is as usual the SIA high standards and the interior and seats are well- maintained and not worn out despite being an old aircraft. In overall, the entire experience with Singapore Airlines journey was splendid and worth the money, will definitely fly the carrier again.", "air_title": "Singapore Airlines ", "Customer_name": "Joel Ong"}
