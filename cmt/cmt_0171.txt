What makes SQ special is that even if you are seated in coach, the crew provides you with business class level of service, and try their best to make your flight enjoyable. The only downside is that Singapore Airlines is usually more expensive than other airlines. Yet, I am willing to pay more to travel on this airline.", "air_title": "Singapore Airlines ", "Customer_name": "C Chan"}
