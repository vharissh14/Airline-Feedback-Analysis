SQ operates A330 on this route. Seating arrangement is 2x4x2. We were given the middle section (4 seats) as we traveled with one child and one infant. The seats were comfortable enough with generous leg room. Food was not as tasty as Silk Air and only one option left at that time when the FA served me. Very disappointing! All in all, still unhappy with the SIA in-flight services, I personally think the services are going downhill.", "air_title": "Singapore Airlines ", "Customer_name": "E Santoso"}
