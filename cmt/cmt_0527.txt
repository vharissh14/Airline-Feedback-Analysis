The QR ground staff were knowledgeable and helpful. The cabin crew were friendly. The food, wines, champagne, soft drinks, tea etc. that was served were of excellent quality. The business class seats on the Boeing 777-300ER aircraft's which we took on every sector were very comfortable, it is a lie flat bed with built in massage options, there is lots of leg room. The seats are very comfortable. The Salvatore Ferragamo amenities were fantastic. All four flights took off on time and landed early. The cabin crew and cockpit crew kept passengers informed about any important updates such as weather etc. All our luggage was at the carousel on time. I highly recommend QR.", "air_title": "Qatar Airways ", "Customer_name": "S Dharmasena"}
