On all sectors LGW-DXB-BKK and BKK-DXB-LGW I had a pleasant flight. Flight crew were extremely helpful, smiling all the time, food and drinks were served on time and food was surprisingly tasty. Fleet that served us on different legs of the journey were as following, LGW-DXB was on B777-300ER, DXB-BKK was on A380-800, BKK \u0096DXB was on A380-800, DXB-LGW was on B777-300ER. Seating arrangements on both Emirates B777-300ER and A380-800 is 3-4-3, I have always considered these seating arrangements to be very cramped. Surprisingly Emirates somehow made it feel specious with plenty of leg room. Entertainment on board both B777-300ER and A380-800 was wonderful, with over 1000 channels of entertainment to choose from flying cannot get boring. If you do manage to get bored then many of the Emirates B777 and A380 are fitted with inflight WIFI internet OnAir at a very reasonable price. I paid \u00a30.63 for 600mb that's enough to last me on all my sectors. Overall I enjoyed everything Emirates had to offer, staff were very helpful, on board and on ground. Services offered on board were more than I expected. Entertainment, food and drinks on board were by the best I have had so far on an aeroplane. I would definitely recommend flying with Emirates if you haven't flown before.", "air_title": "Emirates ", "Customer_name": "Solanki Divyesh"}
