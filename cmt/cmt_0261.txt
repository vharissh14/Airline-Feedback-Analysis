Very disappointing. What has happened to Singapore Airlines? The standard of the aircraft was just not up to today's standards and that's not because I usually fly Emirates which is in another class altogether compared to this flight, at the same price! The whole interior of the aircraft was that of the 1980's. The seats were old and didn't function properly, entertainment screen was tiny, dim (even on full brightness) and blurry. I flew economy, but felt sorrier for business class where seats looked like they were out of the 1970\u0092s. Yes there are some other airlines that are as bad, but you pay for what you get and this flight was not cheap. Note: even low cost airlin s these days have new fresh interiors albeit basic.", "air_title": "Singapore Airlines ", "Customer_name": "H Davis"}
