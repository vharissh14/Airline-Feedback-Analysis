Although the A330 is not my favourite plane, the SQ A330 has the upgraded regional biz product in a 2-2-2 configuration, which is way better than the old standard recliner biz seats on the 777-200. Happy to see the new product on this popular route.", "air_title": "Singapore Airlines ", "Customer_name": "Tercon Bojan"}
