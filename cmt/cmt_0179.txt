Experience with faults, and the airports excellent too. The staff remembered our small requests and returned throughout the flight to say that they had not forgotten. My son's request from the standard adult menu was given first. Our seats were comfortable and the plane clean. The food was good but meat a bit tough, the Asian option was better. I have flown Adelaide to London frequently and this trip was the best by far. From check-in through to meeting my family at Arrivals, I could not find fault. It's a long flight but I felt the better for it (and family commented on it too!) at the end due to it being so easy. Singapore Airlines really are the best for economy long haul.", "air_title": "Singapore Airlines ", "Customer_name": "S Gerrard"}
