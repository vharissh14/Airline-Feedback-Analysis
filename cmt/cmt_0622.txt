The flight itself on a 777 was good and my wife and I managed to get a decent rest on the angled seats. Had a very enthusiastic crew serving us with a smile. Dinner was well presented. We missed breakfast as we were asleep. Departure and arrival on time. Aircraft equipped with older ICE but not a problem on this medium haul night flight. Main negatives at check-in and upon arrival. I was very surprised that our reserved seats (9 K and J) were no longer assigned to us even though booked more than 6 months in advance. I am platinum with QF (code share on this flight) so got a bit upset as the check-in staff at the first class check- in in BKK tried to put us in to the middle row of three with one aisle and one middle seat. After rejecting this seat change, lady suddenly \"found\" seats 10 K and J for us. Could not work out why our initially reserved seats were no longer available (managed to look at the boarding passes of both passengers sitting in 9 K & J and they had no status with EK or QF). Second negative aspect of the trip during luggage collection at SYD. Even though our 2 suitcases were both properly labeled with \"First\" labels and we checked-in at BKK 2.5 hours prior to departure, our suitcases appeared as one of the last items on the belt in Sydney. As I said to my wife, first economy passengers of our flight were already checking in to their hotels in Sydney while we were still waiting for our baggage. An overall great flight but check-in at BKK and luggage return in SYD needs to be improved. Also not impressed with the EK Lounge in BKK. Looks new and cozy with good food and drink on offer but the chairs are very uncomfortable.", "air_title": "Emirates ", "Customer_name": "P Schweizer"}
