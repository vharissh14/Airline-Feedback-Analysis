The leg between Tokyo to Doha was on a 777. Quite comfortable. Service was excellent and the staff very attentive. The crew definitely put in the added little extra attention that makes the difference. Aircraft very clean etc. Trip from Doha to South Africa on the 787. While this aircraft is rather impressive, I found the entire experience heavily marred by the presence of the entertainment box under the seat in front of you. This can really make it nigh on impossible to get into a comfortable position. I had read the reviews and didn't think it would be such a big deal. At the beginning it isn't, but after some hours it starts to become a problem. On the way back I was actually relieved to get off the 787 and onto the 777 for the trip to Tokyo. Having said that, the service on the 787 was of the same high standard that made up for the seat discomfort caused by the entertainment box. All in all, the airline itself is excellent and the service quality very high. Qatar definitely deserve the 5 star rating that they have. Would definitely fly Qatar again, definitely. But would try to avoid the 787.", "air_title": "Qatar Airways ", "Customer_name": "Benjamin Lawrence"}
