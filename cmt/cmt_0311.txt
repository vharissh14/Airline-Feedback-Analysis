SQ232 and 231 on A380 and SIN/BKK sectors on A330. Having flown with the rest, I have now again, flown with the best. Return flight SIN to SYD not full - was seated upstairs and upon request was granted exit row seats without fuss. Everything about these flights was near perfect and yet the fares paid were no different from the other airlines. Most pleasant, relaxing flights with nothing more needing reporting. Definitely, a cut above the rest.", "air_title": "Singapore Airlines ", "Customer_name": "K Piddick"}
