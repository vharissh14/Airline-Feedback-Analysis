Much cheaper than BA direct flight which we have used before. Service, comfort and food all several grades better than BA as well. Well worth the extra 6 hours journey time and change in Doha for the better comfort and service alone. Change at Doha with 2 hour window was easy and actually broke the journey nicely. Will do again.", "air_title": "Qatar Airways ", "Customer_name": "Ian Swithinbank"}
