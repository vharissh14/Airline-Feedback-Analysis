Very good service from the crew but can be a bit slow in getting drinks and food out. Business cabin is what you would expect from a quality airline like QR, very good. IFE is good and food is not bad for airline food. All flights were on time. Business class in the dreamliner is excellent, would love to fly a longer route on it. The lounge in DOH is excellent and massive! The Lounge in Phuket is a joke, operated by Thai Airways, I dont know why QR use it as the lounge beside it which Etihad use is much better. Definitely would fly Qatar again and recommend them.", "air_title": "Qatar Airways ", "Customer_name": "Ross Kelly"}
