I paid 800 euros to have my wife upgraded to Premium Economy and would not advise anyone to commit such foolishness. This old 777-200 was to torn down with the space between the wall covers in the toilets filled up with filth. The seats were so hard that I decided to check what was going on and found out that the only separation between my\u0093derriere and the seat metal structure was a 3 mm thin foam. Finally, do not believe AF fancy adds about the food served in Premium Economy. We were served exactly the same meagre and unsavory portions as in Economy. When my wife got hungry about 6 hours after the meal, she was informed that she had to wait for another two hours before to get anything. I can't say much about the crew because we seldom saw them. When I introduced a complaint in the AF system, I was informed that due to an unusual number of complaints, I should not expect anything form them before 3 weeks. No surprise here.", "air_title": "Air France ", "Customer_name": "C Obadia"}
