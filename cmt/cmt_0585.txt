However, most disappointing was the crew onboard as they were very rude and made us passengers seem like an inconvenience. I was expecting a lot more from an airline like emirates in terms of customer service onboard. The food was also quite poor, even for economy class.", "air_title": "Emirates ", "Customer_name": "R Evans"}
