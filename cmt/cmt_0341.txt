I generally found them to be a value airline, but my opinion is changing. I flew from HoChiMinhCity to Kuala Lumpur, return. As with most discount airlines, the \"all in price\" listed in the booking is hard to find. First of all you have to wade through the various ad-ons for baggage, insurance etc, deducting them as you go or you end up with an inflated fare. But to my surprise, as I hadn't experienced this gouge before, the booking imposed a $12 fee for using my credit card. As well the onboard duty free sales do not take credit cards, only Malaysian currency and US dollars, despite stating that all major currencies were accepted. My seat-mate on the inbound flight had to convince staff to accept Euros. All in all after all costs were added up, the flight was only marginally cheaper than Vietnam Airlines, and far less hassle with a full service carrier. Air Asia advertises low-cost, but their fares have risen dramatically in the past few years. I don't think the average customer wants to have to spend time and energy having to find the \"all in price\", deducting the various ad-ons, only to be stung at the end with the credit card charge. By then you are so fed up with the search for the initial fare, that you just agree to pay the \"fine\" for using your credit card. In my caes it amounted to a surcharge of about 15%. The credit card companies charge their customers 3%. Flying discount airlines can be the only reasonable cost way to fly to some destinations. But always compare, \"all in\" is an advertising pitch, leaving you to find it.", "air_title": "AirAsia ", "Customer_name": "R McBurney"}
