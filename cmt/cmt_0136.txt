Rather tired looking 777 to Singapore. TV kept changing between colour and black and white. Seemed understaffed for the number of passengers on board. Return flight on an A380 - no sound at my seat. Again seemed understaffed for a full plane. Trying to change flight date, even with changeable ticket, was painful.", "air_title": "Singapore Airlines ", "Customer_name": "P Thomas"}
