Having their base in DMK airport is a strategic move away from the chaotic Suvarnbhumi. Make sure you booked earlier as the ticket will be almost as expensive as the regular cost airline given booking only a couple weeks ahead. Check-in both DMK and PHN is no problem. Though I seem to have problem with mobile online check-in from my last trip.", "air_title": "AirAsia ", "Customer_name": "Vithiea Peang"}
