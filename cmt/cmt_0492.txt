Excellent food and drink provided by good crews. Seats comfortable but a bit tight for anyone in the window seats due to the 2-2 configuration. IFE extensive but control via the i-phone style handset a bit temperamental. As a flight that was basically a 'freebie', helped by passenger loads under 50%, this was very enjoyable. However, if the flights had been full I suspect I wouldn't have enjoyed it as much.", "air_title": "Qatar Airways ", "Customer_name": "G Mossom"}
