Very effective service on the ground and onboard the plane. Food and wine were fine. Only problem was luggage delivery (30 minutes + and no priority at all, despite proper yellow tag). Always the same problem with AF: they promise more than they can deliver. Furthermore, as always in France, no proper customers service!", "air_title": "Air France ", "Customer_name": "Powilewicz Alexis"}
