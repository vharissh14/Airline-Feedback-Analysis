All 4 legs were Boeing 777-300. Managed to book the 2 seats at the rear of the plane for the entire journey. Legroom not great but managed OK. ICE entertainment system was excellent with a good choice of things to watch. Food provided was nothing to write home about - adequate would be the best term. Flight attendants were OK, nothing outstanding. Polite and pleasant. This was my first time with Emirates and had been led to believe it would be an amazing experience. Turned out to be no better or worse than other carriers who fly these routes. A bit underwhelmed, actually.", "air_title": "Emirates ", "Customer_name": "C Birbeck"}
