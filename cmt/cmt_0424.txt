Booked hot seats, row 14 exit row but would have preferred row 1 - not available. Also booked Red Carpet departure from Bali. I can't recommend this enough. A great treat to be personally escorted from check in, security, customs. Then lounge access. Although the shared lounge was very ordinary. No fault of AirAsia. When flight was called, we were again escorted through departure gate into private mini-bus to the plane. The rest of the queuing passengers seemed aghast to our VIP treatment but well worth ever cent. In fact the cost is minimal. On board meals were OK but limited breakfast are ordered Hotcakes. Flight attendants smiling and answering bells quickly but difficult to understand announcements as others have mentioned. Plane about 50% full. Many seats at rear from row 15 with people stretching out across. No cockpit announcements at all and late arrival by 20 minutes into Perth. Priority luggage off easily.", "air_title": "AirAsia ", "Customer_name": "G Bemrose"}
