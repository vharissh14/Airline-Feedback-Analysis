Trip was on a refitted B777-200ER, registration 9V-SVJ. Actual time inflight was 3hrs 5mins or so. Took off earlier than schedule which was great. Service was good as usual. Crew seem tired since I didn't see any crew change taking place. Drinks service was basic and I still prefer a full drinks cart being pushed out rather than a tray of juices, water, beer and white wine. Food was great. Had a choice between pork with BBQ flavoured rice and chicken with pasta. I had the pork while my companion had the chicken. My pork dish was excellent with tender pork cubes and vegetables were done right. The rice was a little dry, maybe due to overheating. Dessert was bad, tasted nothing like mango cream cake. My companion said the chicken tasted good, though portions are minuscule. Other than that, I asked for 3 cocktails and all of which were honoured. Cabin crew on this leg didn't smile as much, understandable due to exhaustion. IFE is a little dated since they used the old IFE but with bigger screens, fortunately still AVOD. Seats pretty wide and legroom was standard 32 inches. Aisle seats are bad as they had an IFE box below. The flight was full. I tried asking for souvenirs and was given postcards and playing cards, with a smile this time. In conclusion, this trip is value for money and good service like always from SQ.", "air_title": "Singapore Airlines ", "Customer_name": "T Chia"}
