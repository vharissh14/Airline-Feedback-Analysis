Check-in agent was extremely helpful - even though I was travelling on a reward ticket issued by TACA and booked through Avianca (a tortuous provenance one would expect to preclude changes), I asked at check-in if I could take the later, 2230 flight, instead of the 2100 I was booked on, so I could get more work done in the lounge before the flight (and also as I prefer A380 to 777-300ER). Not only did he manage to do this, but having done so he realised my bag had already been tagged and sent down the chute, so printed a new tag, gave me my travel documents then raced off to intercept my bag and re-tag it somewhere in the bowels of T3. Amazing effort (and obviously successful as my bag indeed made it on the right flight). SAS lounge pretty good, nice view of the airfield action. Onboard, SQ were using the hi-J config A380 with business class taking up the entire upper deck. My window seat was the last row and on it\u2019s own between the rear exit just ahead and the galley just behind. Service was very nice as usual from SQ, and again dispelled the myth that they are smiling robots as I had several nice conversations with different members of the crew. Food was a bit of a letdown (seafood and rice dish very bland) but the bed is so good, it\u2019s almost too comfortable - I slept so well that I had awful jetlag for a week, arriving at 6pm incredibly refreshed left me hideously out of synch with the local time zone. I will manage my sleep patterns better and ask for some spicy sauce on the side of my main next time, but SQ remain one of the best in the air.", "air_title": "Singapore Airlines ", "Customer_name": "Charles Kennedy"}
