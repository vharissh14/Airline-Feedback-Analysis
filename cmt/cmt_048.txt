Cabin staff during almost an 10 hours flight appeared 2 times. Snacks during flight are boring and only available in 1 pantry in the economy class on a A380. Toilets looked horrible and we're not cleaned. Seats are old and in our row of 3, 2 had technical problems. Overall, value for money as flying Air France is cheap, however I would not consider to buy a ticket at a regular fare.", "air_title": "Air France ", "Customer_name": "M Buenk"}
