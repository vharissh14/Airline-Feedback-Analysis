Dubai to Mauritius EK701. Homeward Mauritius to Dubai, EK704 on 11/3/15. Mauritius to Heathrow 12/3/15, EK001. Patchy service. If you did get a drink prior to take off it was immediately taken away. The seats were not clean. I actually found dry noodles on my seat on one leg of the journey. I had soup and scrambled egg served cold. You then have to sit and stare at your tray for 20 minutes or more after you have finished one course then wait again for the next. The staff are far too busy, not enough of them, no team work. Have flown Emirates Business Class before and was pleased but not on the huge A380. The only advantage was a fully flat bed but not too much of a bonus when the seats are not clean. Dubai Business Class lounge is like a transport cafe. Too big, too few comfy seats, too few ladies toilets. All in all not value for money. Awful.", "air_title": "Emirates ", "Customer_name": "C Noble"}
