Boeing 777-300 - (F-GSQI). Ticket was purchased directly on the website, on May 2. However seat assignment was not permitted, as long as the passenger makes the check in online, 30 hours prior the departure. I definitely can't say that I agree with such procedure, but it's a way to force passengers to do their own check in. Online check-in went fine, but I was previously informed by the AF reservation agent that all seats would be available, once the system was charged, but definitely this was untrue. Anyhow, I got seats together for myself and my parents. Once onboard, the aircraft was with an issue with the air-conditioning system. So, the plane was hot, just like a sauna. Only when the main door was closed and the engines started working, fortunately, we got fresh air. Flight was completely full. As soon as we took off, crew started the inflight service. Eyeshade and earphones were personally distributed, which was a nice touch. Right after, welcome drink, which included champagne, and a small bag of salty snacks were offered. My vegetarian option was delivered, but the main dish was cold. During the flight, drinks, ice cream and small sandwiches were available in both galleys. Prior to our arrival, hot breakfast was served. At the carousel, our baggage took a life to be delivered.", "air_title": "Air France ", "Customer_name": "M Palumbo"}
