Overall good solid experience, Chauffeurs on all legs were on time and pleasant. Flights on time. Lounges as usual in DXB good with great offering of food and beverage. In Seattle you had to ring a bell and a man would appear from behind a curtain to give you a drink (obviously economizing) no food. Crews on outward leg helpful and professional. Crew on return looked bored and tired and no smiles. Overall good experience. Business with Emirates is I feel is generally a solid product.", "air_title": "Emirates ", "Customer_name": "D Houlihan"}
