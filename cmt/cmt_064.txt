However, it was canceled due to a strike. I was re-booked on Luxair, but I missed connection due the fact connections were too close. I was re- booked on a Lufthansa flight which left on time. On my return flight to Frankfurt, Air France was operating once again, but the service left a lot to the imagination. Most depressing thing about Air France was the fact they serve their customers instant coffee which they prepared in front of you. You would expect instant coffee from a non-coffee culture, such Thailand. Air France can keep their cold croissant, instant coffee and frigid staff.", "air_title": "Air France ", "Customer_name": "Wayne Casimir"}
