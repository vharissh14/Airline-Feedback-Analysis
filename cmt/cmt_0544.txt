Two flights from and to KUL was operated by an A330-200 while both the flights to and from CDG was operated by their all new A380. First leg was a night flight and the crew was fantastic! They were friendly, smiling all the way and nit showing the rushing face even though it was quite a full flight. Food and beverages good, portions not too small and had a wide selections of beverages, as for IFE selections was ok for adults but for kids not very much. On all the other 3 legs, crews were very robotic, but did their job. The A380 was a great plane, seats were spacious enough and modern. Noticed food catered from DOH not that good but still edible... Pilots on all flights landed perfectly but they seem to be mumbling all the time. Price of tickets were very reasonable and affordable. Thumbs up for Qatar Airways!", "air_title": "Qatar Airways ", "Customer_name": "O Ethan"}
