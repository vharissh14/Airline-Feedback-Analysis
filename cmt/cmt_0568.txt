A Tale of Two Cities! The contrast between these two flights was vast so the data below is an average of both, hence here is my review for each leg. Leg One, Birmingham to Dubai. Plane full, seats squashed, leg room limited, staff mainly rushed and miserable, touch screen sensitivity useless. Leg Two, Dubai to Birmingham. Plane full, seats much larger in width and leg room, wonderful attentive staff, new screen with light touch sensitivity. No headphones provided to me. The price was \u00a3480 return with a return in July which was excellent and was much cheaper than from HRW with a better and shorter DXB layover of 2 hours. Would use again. Two gripes - advertisements at beginning of films and shows annoy me, so an ability to just watch 20 seconds of a bit of each film in order to get the gist of it would be great, I have no time to wade through numerous adverts just to eliminate 80% of the substandard films. Gripe Number Two, yes, its the Emirates Music! Great when you only fly them occasionally but hideous when it just goes on and on and on, a four chord repeat monotony, come on Emirates how about the sound of silence?", "air_title": "Emirates ", "Customer_name": "Jackson David"}
