Going was a pretty new 777-300. Main meal was good however usual terrible Air France breakfast of some hard bread and tea/coffee. Seats were OK, nothing special. Stop in CDG was poor as usual, not the airline's fault though. CDG is the worst designed, overpriced airport I have ever been to. Coming back slightly older 777 with no USB port which was annoying. Very uncomfortable seats, couldn't really get into any sleeping position. Service is almost non existent apart from meal times and one or two drinks rounds. You have to get yourself to the back of the plane and help yourself to drinks and ice cream, but they don't tell you this, so if you don't know then no drinks for you!", "air_title": "Air France ", "Customer_name": "K Kothari"}
