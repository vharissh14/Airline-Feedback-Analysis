QR734/556 and 733/557. DFW-DOH-BOM R/T on QR 777 (LR and ER) in business with family over the holidays. I flew Cathay in First from LAX-HKG R/T just a few days earlier and felt that this experience was on par with CX First and in some areas even better - and that says a lot as CX is world class. In my 15 years of top tier business travel, this business class experience stood out as the best. Right from the pre departure drinks service to the excellent restaurant style (and quality) meals, to the amenities on board (excellent Ferragamo and Armani kits, mattress pads, duvets, pyjamas, superb champagnes) to the crew and the world class new lounge at Hamad - this was an experience! The Business/First lounge at Hamad is huge (not Emirates huge) but manageable. The shower amenities (L'Occitane) and the restaurants in the lounge are excellent (yes Krug is still being served in the business restaurant). The bus transfer (once) was in a bus with 8 lounge style sofa seats. A good way to start the new year!", "air_title": "Qatar Airways ", "Customer_name": "Thakkar Deepak"}
