I spent 13 hours at Kathmandu airport this weekend waiting for a flight back to London via Doha. Weather may be beyond their control but how they respond to it is not. They were the last of the airlines to be able to land, and filled the first flights in with passengers on later scheduled flights in priority to ourselves who had waited the longest. Consequently our 12.30pm flight finally got away at 9.30pm when they appeared to find an extra plane under the sofa . Not a great disaster in the scheme of things but if I have a choice of an airline that makes an attempt to get those who have waited the longest away first, then I will take it. 2) Comfort: The seats appear to be ergonomically designed for maximum discomfort. I am a 5ft 5\" guy who weights 8 stone and I had problems, I can't imagine what it must be like if you are taller and wider. After about 2 hours in to a 7 hours flight I was really struggling. That said, I can't fault the service-the cabin crew were efficient, friendly and attentive. Shame then about 1 and 2.", "air_title": "Qatar Airways ", "Customer_name": "T Fosgate"}
