Flights were on time and all in all fine. Long haul flight landed even 50 min early in Paris. FA's were friendly. Food was good, especially the wine. I didn't like the very uncomfortable seat on the 777-300 it was impossible to sleep in it. The seat pitch on the other hand was fine. In total, I had good flights with Air France. They brought me safe and on time to my final destination.", "air_title": "Air France ", "Customer_name": "M Christoph"}
