Started off well in the lounge with good service but as soon as I stepped onto the plane, the AC was not working. The plane set off with a known fault. During the flight, my in-flight system was not working and eventually I gave up. Furthermore on landing, we were held on the tarmac without any update from the pilot and to compound a totally miserable flight the walkway was unable to be used due to power loss (not the fault of QA but added to the misery with pilots going into radio silence). What saved me from scoring the trip satisfaction as 1/10 was the usual impeccable flight crew service - top class. QA can do much better and on this flight, the experience was anything but a 5* standard.", "air_title": "Qatar Airways ", "Customer_name": "Navid Akram"}
