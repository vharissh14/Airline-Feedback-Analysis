On the flight QR564 from Doha to Delhi on 19 March, I had very severe earache and I must say that the chief steward really went the extra mile, providing me with a hot honey and lemon drink - mush appreciated and really unexpected for an economy class passenger! However, the boarding at Delhi on 8th March was a terrible experience - standing in 5 queues for an hour and a half at dawn is not funny especially for a senior citizen. Also, there was no in-flight entertainment on the flight from Doha to Nairobi, nor on the one from Dar es Salaam to Doha. Plus the meal served on the Doha Delhi flight was really substandard - some kind of chicken korma!", "air_title": "Qatar Airways ", "Customer_name": "Solomon Roma"}
