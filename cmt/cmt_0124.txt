A full 777-300 with much dreaded 3-4-3 seating. Was lucky and got a window-seat all the way in the back in a double-seat. Still not very comfortable. Seat-pitch is not 32\" as AF says. Seat is hard, recline of the kind where seat slides forward as you use recline button. IFE very good and easy to use. As always: You see the (always polite) crew the first 1.5 hour of the flight and then again the very last hour. Be it day or night flight. For the first time with AF, I saw the cabin-crew serving water from bottles between meals. Hot meal is fine, the so called breakfast a joke for us who do not rely entirely on sugar. I have now learned how to go from terminal 2F/E to 2G with the \"on-tarmac shuttle-bus\", and it makes the connection very fast and easy. Recommend AF? Only if price is low. Prefer sister airline in the AirFrance/KLM group, but they are usually slightly more expensive from Norway.", "air_title": "Air France ", "Customer_name": "L Roestad"}
