A380 for the first and third legs, B777 for the second and fourth. Booked early enough to get the upstairs economy cabin for the A380 flights, seats in rows of two with a storage bin on the window side. Only quibble, which is trivial, is that the library of movies and audio books wasn't that great. Helpful cabin crew rebooted non-functioning IFE very promptly on one leg. Fruit option for meals excellent. Hot towels and regular juice/water supplies much appreciated and the service across the board could not be faulted - the crews seem highly efficient anyway but it helps that there are enough staff for them not to get irritable through needing to work at breakneck pace. We've done this journey with Qantas when they flew Heathrow-Sydney Singapore but switched because a Dubai-Sydney leg is just too long. T3 at Changi is an oasis of calm compared to Dubai and if you book flights with a medium layover you can be asleep in the airside transit hotel minutes after landing. A definite choice of airline and route when we next make the trip.", "air_title": "Singapore Airlines ", "Customer_name": "P Tanner"}
