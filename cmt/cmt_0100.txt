Flight departed on time, boarding times were good considering that the plane was an A380 (still, however, if you do not like waiting to board on long lines, then I suggest you take one of their several other daily flights). Food was free and decent, legroom was pretty good. Crew were friendly and professional. My baggage arrived in CDG with the flight. Didn't have to pay for my first checked bag (I would suggest trying to fit everything into one, however as the second bag is expensive). My only complaint is that I had checked in online and only had to drop off a bag at JFK's check-in desks, but the line was huge and it was not apparent that there was a separate line for people like me. Overall a very good trip - it was also the cheapest ticket for the flight.", "air_title": "Air France ", "Customer_name": "Eden Vance"}
