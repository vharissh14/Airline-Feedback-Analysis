Aircraft was changed from A380 to Triple 7, booked seating was changed. Pre-ordered meals were given to the wrong people. Dinner was served cold, after dinner the crew were difficult to get hold off. We asked for a bottle of water and were refused, had to wait ages for a 1/2 cup of water. Would it not been easier to give passengers a bottle of water rather than passengers buzzing continuously for a drink. Qantas from the UK to Dubai was the opposite. Crew were courteous, and we were given a bottle of water-how difficult was that.", "air_title": "Emirates ", "Customer_name": "Julie Carter"}
