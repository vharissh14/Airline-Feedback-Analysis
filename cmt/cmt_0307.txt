What a great way to fly! Service was excellent, got addressed by name on all 4 sectors and food was generally high standard overall. We tried the 'Book the Cook' Service and ordered their famous Lobster Thermidor. It was very good. The waffles unfortunately were terrible. The seat itself is very wide and not too bad for sleeping if you sleep diagonally. It was my first time in the seats and I didn't realise that the seat back didn't go back flat the full width of the seat. Perhaps the only disappointing thing would be the KrisWorld Entertainment System - it wasn't as extensive in selection of movies as say Cathay Pacific. The lounges were very good especially the Turkish Airlines one in Istanbul - incredible!!! This was a FF Points trip -if only we could afford to fly like this all the time.", "air_title": "Singapore Airlines ", "Customer_name": "C Chun"}
