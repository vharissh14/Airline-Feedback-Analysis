ATH-CDG: Slept through this flight other than a quick breakfast which tasted alright, no other comments on this flight. CDG-LAX: Airbus A380 (AF66). We flew near the rear of the aircraft, which was quite empty, to the surprise of my group as well as the flight attendants. After seeing this, I went to move seats, but was reprimanded by the flight attendants to sit down, even though the seat belt sign had not yet been illuminated! After taking my seat, it was clear the seats were much wider than those I had been on before, measuring at about 19.0\" wide. The food that was served was fantastic, starting with a nice tortellini with squash, and ending with an ice cream sandwich. There was a second meal served at a later point, which also tasted nice. Between meals I used the IFE, which had a great selection, but was unresponsive at times and seemed to take a long time to load. Some of my friends had issues in terms of functionality as well. Arrival was very uneventful, with the lengthy lines in customs to deal with. Overall I really enjoy Air France and hope to fly them again.", "air_title": "Air France ", "Customer_name": "Jeremy Chesney"}
