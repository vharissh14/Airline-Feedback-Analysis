The airport where Air Asia international flights depart is supposed to be a domestic airport. My flight was at 4.20pm. I arrived at the airport around 1.30pm. Past 2pm, they were not still letting us in. The waiting area and check in area is still serving the earlier flight to Korea. They just have 2 check in counters and 2 immigration counters of a supposed to be international terminal. I am from the Philippines and I feel for the foreigners who were with me on this terminal. I hope Air Asia can transfer all of their international flights to Terminal 3. Will take Air Asia to Manila once they transfer.", "air_title": "AirAsia ", "Customer_name": "Chris Tan"}
