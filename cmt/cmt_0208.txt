The flight to Milan was a Boeing 777-300. Service was again excellent throughout the flight and deserved praise. Food and IFE was great. The return flight from Rome was old model, Boeing 777-200ER. The plane although looked new on the outside was old on the inside. IFE screen was poor and far outdated then the one they currently use on their newer models. Though I felt more comfortable in the seats. However I do not know why SIA still doesn't retire this old model. Clearly, footrest, seats and even the IFE was in a need of repair. Service on this flight was not as great as the previous flight. Request were sometimes miss and food options ran out, something i had not experience before with SIA. A letdown this time for the return flight. I would still recommend based on the outbound flight from Singapore.", "air_title": "Singapore Airlines ", "Customer_name": "Zachary Ho"}
