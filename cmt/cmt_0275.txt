Unfortunately it has lost much of its shine, and has reduced itself to relying on price advantage to survive the onslaught by more progressive, truly international airlines, which are more in tune with today's international travellers. Case in point: during my last 2 trips from Melbourne to Singapore and back, on First and Business Class, 1) Cabin crews lack communication and English language skills, most are not able to carry a decent, mature conversation. 2) Male crews lack discipline and female crews rushing around like pre-programmed robots without genuine warmth. 3) Filthy leather seats and the lack of general cleanliness show up an ageing, tired airline. 4) Second rate food even in First with badly stocked kitchens without essentials such as Soy milk for coffee and fresh chilli sauce for food. And the list goes on. Wake up Singapore, the world has moved on.", "air_title": "Singapore Airlines ", "Customer_name": "Chiew Robin"}
