I have travelled on Singapore Airlines B777-200 on the last segment of my trip. The aircraft was old, the inflight entertainment system is poor and the seat is also old. I was quite surprised to see that Singapore Airlines is still flying with this old thing. Food was just acceptable but nothing special. The meal service (dinner) was very late. This keeps you awake for most of the flight waiting for the dinner and just fall to sleep a few minutes before arrival.", "air_title": "Singapore Airlines ", "Customer_name": "P Gennai"}
