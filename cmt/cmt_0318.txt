JFK to FRA on an A380. Luxury product with Givenchy amenities: blanket, pillows, table linens, cutlery, tableware, etc. Food of very good quality, ordered one of the \"Book the Chef\" options, impressive beverage selection, with a large list of cocktails as a plus! The crew is the key here, simply one of the best in-flight experiences ever! They know their product and how to enhance it! Always adressed me with my last name, and always with a genuine smile.", "air_title": "Singapore Airlines ", "Customer_name": "Lopez Roberto"}
