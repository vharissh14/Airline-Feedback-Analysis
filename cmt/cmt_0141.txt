A330-300 on both legs. Impeccable service from the minute you board to the minute you get off the plane. Hot towels were served shortly after boarding, followed by food. Very courteous and pleasant crew members and at all times kept toilets clean. The aircraft's PTV was good. The seat on A330 was nice, can stretch longer than some full services airline in Asia and it's comfortable. Overall, a very pleasant experience, and it's always a pleasure to fly Singapore Airlines.", "air_title": "Singapore Airlines ", "Customer_name": "William Lay"}
