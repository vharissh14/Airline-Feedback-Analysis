Got assigned seat 3A in Premium Eco on LHR-CDG leg, which is always nice and seems to happen to me quite often on this route. It doesn't make much of a difference on such a short flight - even though you do get better food - but sitting at the front of the aircraft makes the boarding/ disembarking process a breeze. Transfer between to 2E and 2F at CDG can be a bit of a hassle but both terminals are new and relatively easy to navigate. Nothing exceptional on CDG-LYS leg but an overall pleasant experience.", "air_title": "Air France ", "Customer_name": "A Serre"}
