All flights via newish A320s. A little chaotic at check in for DMK flights but otherwise the boarding process was easy. Be aware though that they strictly enforce their carry on baggage regulations and I suggest you pay for a checked bag when you buy your ticket and carefully weigh it before check in. Plane interiors clean, comfort OK for short flight and service friendly but I hate the banner ads on the luggage bins. Checked bags were delivered promptly on arrival.", "air_title": "AirAsia ", "Customer_name": "Brian Robinson"}
