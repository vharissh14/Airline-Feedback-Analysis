Given the only choice on this direct route is either Emirates or United, it's not really much in the way of competition - give me Emirates every time. Emirates has an excellent on-demand in-flight entertainment system, decent food, efficient multi-lingual staff, amenity packs in economy on long-haul flights, and all drinks except champagne are complementary in economy. No one really wants to be stuck on a plane for 15 hours, but it's on these really long routes that the little extras on Emirates - especially the in-flight entertainment system and power outlets for every seat - come into their own.", "air_title": "Emirates ", "Customer_name": "Alasdair Brooks"}
