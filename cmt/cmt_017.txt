Service diabolical, seat uncomfortable, food and beverage very average - all in all the most underwhelming of experiences, just like BA in their nationalised period. The most extraordinary experience was to be told by 2 stewardesses over an hour between them to put out my reading light and go to sleep. 58 years ago, aged 6, I might have accepted it but how utterly inappropriate behaviour. The first one actually reached past me and switched it off (this was maybe 30 minutes after they dimmed cabin lights after very poor food service). An hour or so later the second one tried and got a very brusque \"go away and leave me alone\" from me. This stunned her into saying \"you can't speak to me like that\" to which I responded \"I have, now go away\". When did it become company policy for AF to treat customers like 6 year olds? Probably the most unsatisfactory flight I've ever taken.", "air_title": "Air France ", "Customer_name": "A Markland"}
