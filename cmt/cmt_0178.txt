I used to love this seat 7 years ago, when they launched it, however today it doesn't measure up to its competition. Especially given the price. You always tend to sit sideways which is discomforting after a while, especially on this long-haul flight from Singapore to LA via Tokyo on the A380. This must have been one of their oldest A380's for the seat was tattered and basically a lot of wear-and-tear was evident in the cabin and lavatories. Moreover, the IFE didn't work in my seat which was very annoying on this long flight. They tried to fix it onboard, as well as during the Tokyo layover, with no success. Since the flight was full, I couldn't change seats. The food though, was outstanding.", "air_title": "Singapore Airlines ", "Customer_name": "Tercon Bojan"}
