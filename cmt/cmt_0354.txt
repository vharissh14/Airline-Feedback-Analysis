Only complaint would be about their partner optiontown. I paid for an upgrade and booking fee for 2 via their website about 2 months prior to our flight. About 4 hours before the flight I received an email saying our flight upgrade was unsuccessful. We got on the plane to an announcement that there were upgrades available to business class for almost double what we originally paid - 4 in fact. We feel ripped off. I do not accept their were 4 business class cancellations. Either Air Asia or their partner Optiontown are guilty of charging our booking fee for no service.", "air_title": "AirAsia ", "Customer_name": "Chris Payne"}
