Eight hour flight, arrived at 5:10 AM. Required check-in in Los Angeles on transfer from Delta. No indication of location of Air France Counters outside of International Terminal. Sky Priority check-in very hectic, so much that we just made it to the plane as they were boarding. Flight was okay, except my traveling companion and I were separated in our seat assignments as were other travelers, and the flight attendants managed to re-seat everyone except us - French speakers first.", "air_title": "Air France ", "Customer_name": "Paul Hoshall"}
