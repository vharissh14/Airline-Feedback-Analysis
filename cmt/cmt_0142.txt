The plane was an Airbus A380. The service was nice and the food delicious. The only problem was the inflight entertainment system, the music and the movies would stop now and then for the entire flight even though there was no announcements. Despite that, this is a very pleasant flight and I would definitely fly using this airline again.", "air_title": "Singapore Airlines ", "Customer_name": "Ravindra Nabiel"}
