First leg on the A380 double decker, second leg Boeing 777\\200 series. Return flight 14th June as above but Singapore to London to our disappointment the aircraft was changed to a Boeing 777 300er series much prefer the A380. Cannot fault the service staff, very polite did their job well - we were given plenty of drinks during the flight. Seating and legroom good with good choice of entertainment. All flights very punctual.", "air_title": "Singapore Airlines ", "Customer_name": "Davis Jennifer"}
