We had the pleasure of flying Air Asia out of KL and Thai Air Asia out of Bangkok, HCMC and Phisanulok. On all occasions check in was quick and efficient with clear direction given, boarding spoken in English, seat allocation and comfort fine with ample space for the short haul flights, FA's were well presented with good command of English, flights all left on time, food and beverage acceptable with good pricing compared to other budget airlines, no IFE but most people talked to their partner the old fashion way of communication which made the flight seem short. Overall my wife and myself were very pleased we chose Air Asia to travel around SE Asia and would have no hesitation in booking to fly with them again.", "air_title": "AirAsia ", "Customer_name": "Thompson Mark"}
