Service was excellent! Welcomed with hot towel. Food was great. Staff was efficient. Flight entertainment was absolutely excellent. IFE screen was wide and large. The ICE widescreen was just great. Passengers was given access to front and bottom camera, allowing those who sit on aisle sit to see what happens outside the plane. Powerpoint and USB port was available, and I could charge my mobile phone! Plenty of films/TV show in multiple languages. Cabin was clean, and the mood based lightning was synched to the skylight outside the plane. Staff were efficient and helpful.", "air_title": "Emirates ", "Customer_name": "D Vincensiu"}
