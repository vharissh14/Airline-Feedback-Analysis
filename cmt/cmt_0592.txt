Perth-Dubai - business cabin. (Qantas partner). Beautiful lounge with excellent, friendly service. Plane clean and smart with seats/flat beds very comfortable. Nicely appointed, well decorated cabin, crew helpful, attentive and smiley. Food although not exceptional was more than acceptable and service was first class. No complaints whatsoever about the flight. The problems began at Dubai. Very busy so held before landing. Dumped at least a 20 min bus trip from terminal. No information of where connecting (Qantas) flight was departing from. No one in terminal to ask. Inserted boarding pass into state of art machine that was supposed to tell us where to go - it didn't. 15/20 min fast walk to train to change terminals. Rush to gate and just made it as gate was closing. 4 people at least didn't make it and had bags off-loaded. This was simply not good enough. Took the edge off the whole Emirates experience - such a shame. Would imagine this problem will go once airport finished! Would fly Emirates again but would, in the meantime, ensure at least 3 hour transfer time. Qantas booked this connection not us.", "air_title": "Emirates ", "Customer_name": "G Lee"}
