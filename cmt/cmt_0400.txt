The Surat Thani airport is very small, you go down an escalator and walk onto the tarmac to board the plane. The plane boarded on-time and very quickly. The flight staff were still vacuuming when I boarded! They boarded the plane quickly and had an easy departure and easy landing. The distance between seats is really small. I am not a big person, but these seats are very close! They do recline, but not much. Not very comfortable for a long flight, but for a short flight you can put up with it. The price was pretty reasonable. They do charge for everything though. I paid extra for a seat assignment, one piece of luggage, and a chicken dinner. Total came to around $2600 Bhat, which is about $80 USD. For a short flight it was fine although the seats are not very comfortable.", "air_title": "AirAsia ", "Customer_name": "S Hirshfield"}
