New high quality equipment with great attention to detail from very professional staff. Connection to BKK flight in DXB international was a disgrace. Was looking forward to flying the A380 but experience was just not the same, 20% of the staff did very little while the others were extremely busy on a very full flight. Conclusion, other airlines should take note.", "air_title": "Emirates ", "Customer_name": "Thomas Kelly"}
