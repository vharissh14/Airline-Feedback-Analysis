All flights on time. B787-800 DOH-CPH-DOH on B787-800 and A330-200 on the DOH-SGN leg. Food good, but much less and of slightly deteriorating quality as compared to previous flights. FA\u0092s professional, hard working, coping, and caring, despite the flights were full. Economy on 787 is nothing above normal, seats are cramped and exit seats cannot always decline. Gold-tier members recognised in economy (2 out of 3 times). Champagne made available on all flights. Bus-transfers in Doha still frequent and tedious and constitute anti-climax on otherwise spotless trips. New Al Mourjan lounge in Doha huge, impressive but lacks personality, decorations, and toilets. Meals on order.", "air_title": "Qatar Airways ", "Customer_name": "Anders Pedersen"}
