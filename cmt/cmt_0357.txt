To do this within my allotted time span, I had no alternative but to fly between these cities. The price differential is quite marked, so I elected to try Air Asia, which would allow me to compare it with Bangkok Airways, who I had flown with before. The aircraft was configured as a single cabin. The first few rows sported cotton covers over the seat headrest and were reserved for passengers willing to pay a premium. The other seats were so close together, that for any person over five feet six inches (like myself) were forced into a painful contortion to avoid digging their knees into the seat-back in front. Minutes after the aircraft departed, the four cabin crew members wasted no time in blocking the aisles with trolleys flogging drinks and snacks, followed quickly by the same four trying their best to get passengers to buy mementoes of Air Asia. My next flight (Chiang Mai to Krabi) due to depart at 12 noon was cancelled. Its replacement was rescheduled to depart at 5.30pm. This meant a totally wasted day for me and meant arriving at my pre-booked hotel at 9pm instead of 3pm. No apologies \u0096 no explanations from Air Asia. The only consistency being the aircraft seating configurations and 2 hours of discomfort instead of one. More of the same on my last flight so there is little point in relating it. All in all, my experiences were certainly negative ones.", "air_title": "AirAsia ", "Customer_name": "Brian W Fisher"}
