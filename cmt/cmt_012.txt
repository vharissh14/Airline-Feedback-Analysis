The long-haul was a 'curate's egg' of a journey. On-time, comfortable seats at the front of the 380 (\u00a350 extra well-spent), good choice of entertainment but slow service for drinks and dinner - the nastiest airline meal I've had in years. No water runs through the night and woken up nearly two hours before touchdown to serve breakfast. The CDG-LHR sector was normal short-haul experience.", "air_title": "Air France ", "Customer_name": "Simon Channon"}
