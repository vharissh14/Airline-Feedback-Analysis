This time, it was HKG-LHR with a transit in Singapore (SQ856 and SQ306). The trip was excellent in all respects, especially the catering and the seat, which has footrests unlike CX (which I found to be much needed on 13 hour flights). However, the transit in Changi was confusing, as it is against convention in the way that arrivals and departures are in the same area, and I was trying to find somewhere to go through immigration again, which turns out to be at the gate itself. Also, the A380's on both trips had a good variety in their IFE, despite not being touch screen, because the remote controller was not always responsive. I loved the rear economy section on the upper deck of the A380, it was cosy and small, meaning less noise and less people knocking against you when you are trying to go to the galley or bathroom. The purser was great, trying desperately to look for the other meal option from the downstairs cabin after it ran out on the upper deck. In a nutshell, a well deserved 5 star airline and something that is a class above Emirates.", "air_title": "Singapore Airlines ", "Customer_name": "J Choi"}
