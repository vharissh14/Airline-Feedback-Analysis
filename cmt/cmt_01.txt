It has however introduced in business class what it calls a new \"light\" menu. In fact the light offering is little more than an excuse to serve minuscule portions under the guise of the now discredited \"nouvelle cuisine\". The chief purser on the flight assured me that the new menu was popular, but a quick unscientific survey of my fellow passengers seemed to show the opposite. For the record first course was a tiny block of Foie Gras with overlooked mixed vegetables. Followed by shrimps in a brown tasteless sauce and mashed potatoes (difficult to identify). The desert was a stale pastry. The guest chef (unknown outside of France) who prepared this offering clearly needs extra training on the impact of altitude on the taste of food, come on Air France bring back the much loved classic menu. Meanwhile on a long flight, if not on a diet, bring your own sandwiches!", "air_title": "Air France ", "Customer_name": "Manderstam Andrew"}
