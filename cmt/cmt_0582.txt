Fab driver pick service in all legs from residence to airport to hotel and back and to residence. A big plus! Check in fast as it should be. Fast track and lounge a pity. EK uses SN lounge and it is outdated and crowed always. Whatever time of day. Used not only by Star alliance members but also other partners too, which makes it too warm, overcrowded and nowhere to seat. Boarding ok and then the usual fab experience of EK first class, although on B777 suites are smaller and not the luxury of showers. No amenity kit either. Connecting in Dubai is a mess. Non one around and the first class in concourse C is small and not that good. Again boarding to HKG very average and not prioritized as it should be. A380 excellent experience, not my first one with them but meals are very average. Excellent ICE. Return on HKG - Dubai leg not so good, staff were rude and unpleasant. Again connecting in course C is a mess. Last leg ok. Bag not first out and unfortunately zip was broken and lock missing. To have the bag repaired took me forever and wasted a whole day waiting for a pick up service who after an 8 hour wait never turned up. Very disappointed. Customer service is not good either. However staff in EK office in BRU helpful and hopefully all will be sorted out soon. Not yet done though. I only fly them 1st class and am a gold member but I will think twice when choosing EK again.", "air_title": "Emirates ", "Customer_name": "E Simeone"}
