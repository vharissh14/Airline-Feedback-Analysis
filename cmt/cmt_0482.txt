All flights on A-330 200 . The seatmaps for this type of plane are a little misleading. They all show the 4 rows of Biz Class in one large block, but the reality is rows 1-3 are in the forward cabin and, strangely, row 4 only is on its own in a very small section between the Galley and Econ section. My wife and I were seated in seats 4 J+K. It does feel pretty private, but of course you are more prone to any noise from kids etc behind in Econ. I guess you pays your money and takes your choice! Food copious and excellent quality on all flights, but they can be a bit slow in refilling wine glasses. Even these refurbished A330's are beginning to show their age, and, frankly the seats are rather lumpy and not all that comfortable even when fully flat. Whilst the boarding at both KL and Barcelona was fine, I have to say I was disappointed with that at Doha. 3 out of the 4 flights to or from there were from outlying stands , not jetways. I really find it hard to see how, with a brand new airport that trumpets itself as one of the world's best, that so many flights involve a long trek followed by being herded onto a bus and having to climb steep steps to board . That sort of thing may have been OK on a charter flight to Majorca from Luton in the '80s, but really does not cut the mustard in 2015 on a Business class ticket on a supposedly 5* airline! But, overall, for the price it is a good product.", "air_title": "Qatar Airways ", "Customer_name": "J Fairclough"}
