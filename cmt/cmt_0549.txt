Sunday 14th Dec 2014. First leg on a full to capacity 777. The cabin crew were excellent in dealing with a full aircraft, but the IFE was very poor and limited in choice of films. Also I feel that the standard of food served has fallen considerably. The aircraft itself looked \"tired\". The leg Doha to Manchester in an A330 was a contrast. Very nice aircraft with good IFE, food still of a very average standard, but the real difference was the cabin crew. I got the distinct impression that we were a nuisance and interrupting their rest time. No smiles, indeed they were quite sullen and spent most of the flight sat on their seats by the galley, not even chatting to each other. I doubt very much that I will use Qatar again.", "air_title": "Qatar Airways ", "Customer_name": "Ian Francis"}
