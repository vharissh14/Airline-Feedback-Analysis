My wife and I have flown Singapore Airlines before and have always been more than satisfied with every aspect of the flight. This trip was even better than in the past. The crew on both flights were exceptionally helpful since my wife had hip surgery recently and needed extra attention. We were accommodated at every turn during the flight. The American carriers could learn a lot from Singapore Airlines.", "air_title": "Singapore Airlines ", "Customer_name": "William Knight"}
