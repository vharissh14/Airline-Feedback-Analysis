No bottled water provided. Requested the Japanese breakfast and the meal came without the fish. Anyway, shared the fish with my daughter who ordered the same meal and it was very salty. Requested warm water twice and the crew earnestly promised but never delivered. Upon landing, while the aircraft was still cruising, we could hear the crew arguing loudly among themselves as we occupied the last few row of seats - very unprofessional.", "air_title": "Singapore Airlines ", "Customer_name": "Margaret Lai"}
