Great if US carriers could copy this modely, especially for coast-to-coast travel in the US. Service was obliging for this one-hour sector. Connected in DOH to IAD on a 777-300 and was in seat 6K. Overall, service was good, but somewhat slow due the chief purser having to spend an inordinate amount of time dealing with one selfish and disruptive passenger from Qatar who insisted on bringing his toddler up from economy even though the child not was ticketed in business. He loudly argued with the flight attendants, including telling them that he was friends with the Qatar Airways CEO. The chief purser handled the situation admirably and the child was eventually taken back with his nannies in economy. This overly entitled passenger though the plane was his own and that he could do as he liked. Food was good. Call button not always answered very promptly. Washroom kept clean. A great product overall.", "air_title": "Qatar Airways ", "Customer_name": "M LaPrairie"}
