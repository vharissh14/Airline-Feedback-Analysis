Was hesitant after having read some of the reviews. It had been a couple of years since I had travelled with them last. Was traveling with family so 3 adults and 3 children aged 6, 2, and 1. Overall experience was excellent and would travel with them again. The planes were fairly new. Plus points-Qatar staff at all airports from Manchester to return from Changi were great with children which was our biggest worry. Also were very helpful during all flights. Food and drink were served frequently through all flights. Only some minor negatives, the entertainment for children was very basic - checked prior to flight and a lot of the programmes that had been mentioned were not available on flight which was disappointing. Also pre-ordered my mothers food who eats Asian non veg food but not beef. Requested the Hindu non- veg meal, thinking they will most likely serve Chicken or Lamb for this request, but to my mothers disappointment they served prawns (very lovely indeed from my point of view) so if anyone like my mother you may have to request specifically what you want prior as a special request. Would travel with them again.", "air_title": "Qatar Airways ", "Customer_name": "Younas Safyana"}
