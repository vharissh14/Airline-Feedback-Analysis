I feel the airline has potential if handled properly. The ground staff leave a lot to be desired. Our flight from Bangalore, although boarded on time the crew could not clear for quite a while. Pilot seemed to take each thing at a time effecting delay. The return leg was further confusion as fog delayed the incoming flight but no one was interested to let the passengers know the same. No announcements. Also in the aircraft the crew just forgot to ask all to switch off the phones. If it is not much of a problem then why push for it all other times. Where is the safety when the announcements were not completed. No smoking announcement not made. Some positives though. Good pricing strategy. Fresh aircraft and good potential if staff improve.", "air_title": "AirAsia ", "Customer_name": "Aadi Achint"}
