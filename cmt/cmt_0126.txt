I booked 2 business class tickets 6 months in advance for cost saving. The equipment was changed on the return flight and I was notified of seat changes which required a call. 1 month before the flight they cancelled the return flight and rebooked on a different day without notification although they had email, text, phone information. I discovered this accidentally 3 weeks before the flight and contacted Air France and spent 1.5 hours on the phone making new arrangements with a choice of my money back or a flight on a different day. The flight at this time had almost doubled, so I stayed an additional day with additional costs. When I contacted Air France their complaint process is difficult and eventually unproductive. I fly only once a year international but was disappointed by this airline.", "air_title": "Air France ", "Customer_name": "Mark Faler"}
