On London to Doha QF seems to use a mix of aircraft for their many daily flights, I experienced the A340-300 both there and back. The aircraft is starting to show its age, the seats are uncomfortable and the picture / sound quality on the video on demand sets poor compared to what you get on more modern aircraft these days. However the legroom seemed generous compared to BA, Virgin et al. Service was good, though on the way back they switched on the lights on a night flight while still over Romania, so a good two and a half hours from Heathrow to serve breakfast. Doha's new Hamed International Airport is brand new and a pleasant place to transit through, and from Doha to Dubai Qatar used a Dreamliner for what's only a 45 min flight. Despite small issues here and there I'd definitely take them again. They were the cheapest on the route, and the experience is still better than what you get on most European (let alone N American) carriers long haul. QF and the other Middle Eastern airlines also haven't introduced the practice of making you pay to choose your seat and if you use the app you can change it as many times as you want (in my case I managed to get a free seat next to me on each stretch) pre check in.", "air_title": "Qatar Airways ", "Customer_name": "D Singer"}
