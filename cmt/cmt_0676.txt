First trip on A380 and it was fantastic. Allocated Business class seat on window in row 25 so just a short walk to the fantastic bar area. Seating and amenities were outstanding as was the service from a truly international crew. Entertainment system was the best I have ever used with a wide selection of movies and the flight tracking is brilliant. Food was as good as I have ever had on a flight and there was indeed plenty of it. Overall a wonderful flight and have no hesitation in recommending Emirates Business Class.", "air_title": "Emirates ", "Customer_name": "Craig Willis"}
