I flew Premium Economy from CDG to JFK on the return trip from France. I expected an upgraded level of service, equal to or greater than Economy Comfort on Delta. The hard shell seat was extremely uncomfortable and the \"recline\" (more a sliding function) did not work. Entertainment options were limited and dated. The food was exactly the same as economy - a mush of potatoes and vegetables with a side of chicken in cheese sauce. The only difference was the addition of an unappetizing, brown pate. The second meal service was a stale roll and some yoghurt. The price is outrageous for the level of service offered. I hope Air France will entirely rethink this class of service.", "air_title": "Air France ", "Customer_name": "J Thomas"}
