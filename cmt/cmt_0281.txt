The food and service was superb. I used book the cook for both legs, lamb chops on the second leg were memorable. Champagne was Bollinger. The new business seats are excellent but suffer from the requirement to place ones feet in a small pocket to sleep diagonally. If you can get the bulkhead seats do so as this avoids the problem. I got bulkhead seats for the second leg on the A380. SIA do not offer sleeping suits in business.", "air_title": "Singapore Airlines ", "Customer_name": "Philip Peace"}
