CGK-SIN with a retrofitted 777-200. It has always been nice that SIA has meal options other than standard meal. I opted for fruit platter and everything was tasty. Smooth take-off and landing, arrived SIN on time for connecting flight to Tokyo-NRT. SIN-NRT leg on B777-300ER with brand new interior. Tasty refreshment, breakfast, superb touch-screen IFE, ergonomic seat, comfy headrest. Two thumbs up as always!", "air_title": "Singapore Airlines ", "Customer_name": "Siauw Steve"}
