This was despite our being on the same reservation - with an 8 year old child with us! I was told that a Flying Blue Elite Plus member would have been treated the same way, which is even worse than thinking it was an aberration. This is the second time that Air France's computer system tried to separate my family. Luckily, a very nice agent managed to get this fixed, although we then had to run to the gate. Then, in the flight, the food was truly the worst we have ever eaten on an international flight. My son and I ate almost nothing during an 11 hour flight. The deterioration in Air France's food over the last two years is dramatic. On the positive side, the crew was very nice and the new 380 aircraft was unusually quiet and had decent leg room for economy seats. The entertainment program was also good.", "air_title": "Air France ", "Customer_name": "Douglas Levinson"}
