Both were on A330s with on time arrivals. Something seems different with SQ now; The cabin crew now exude character and warmth. They're quick to start a quick conversation with you and go the extra mile to make sure that your flight is comfortable. Definitely heading back to being one of the best airlines in the world. Keep it up Singapore Airlines! Indeed a great way to fly.", "air_title": "Singapore Airlines ", "Customer_name": "Chew Daniel"}
