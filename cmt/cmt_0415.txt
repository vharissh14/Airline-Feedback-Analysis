The only major problem was when we had to check in a bag (15kg) in Saigon for a whopping US$72. It was more than I paid for my ticket. Service not bad, planes are clean, and FAs are friendly. Bought food for US$6 - extremely small portion and not worth it.", "air_title": "AirAsia ", "Customer_name": "Casper van der Walt"}
