When I picked myself up off the floor, I asked the desk person if I could avoid this sticker shock on my return flight. Told to go to the website, check in online, and 'pre-register' my bag online. The savings would be 'significant'. So today, I did just that. Only problem - when it came to registering the bag, the website froze me out - even after multiple attempts. Simply couldn't register the bag, let alone pay a lower fee for it. When we got to the airport, I explained the situation. We had checked in online, so it was clear I wasn't pulling anyone's leg about trying to get things done on the website. But the check in person gave me the cow in a pasture stare, and charged me full freight for the bag again. I explained again it wasn't my fault - I'd tried to do what her colleague had recommended - but their website wasn't working. I then told my story to the person who took my money. Same look. So watch out! Bag charges are exorbitant, and going online to lessen the charge brings no joy.", "air_title": "AirAsia ", "Customer_name": "Marc Stoiber"}
