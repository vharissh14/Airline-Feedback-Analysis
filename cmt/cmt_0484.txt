CPH-DOH with Boeing 787 Dreamliner. Nice plane, tasty food but very cramped seating on this 6-7 hours flight. Doha-Dubai, shorthaul on an airbus 321 with great legroom, under one hour flight but they serve a small meal and beverages. Dubai-Doha, airbus 330, once again great legroom and service. After the \"spacious\" seating on the short flights the seating felt even more cramped on the longer flight between Doha and Copenhagen. But new clean planes and very friendly helpful staff on all legs still made the trip a pleasure. All flights departed on time and arrived ahead schedule. Smooth boarding.", "air_title": "Qatar Airways ", "Customer_name": "W Charlotte"}
