Had heard that the Premium Economy seats were uncomfortable, but that turned out to be an understatement. They were as hard as park benches. I had to resort to scrounging cushions from other seats to sit on - not worth the price premium. Leg room was OK, and could extend my legs fully under seat in front (I'm 6,2\"). The food was OK, but the service appalling. No attempt was made to deliver an aperitif before the food, but rather had to be requested at the same time. Took a good 45 minutes for them to come and clear away the plates, with all the attendant issues of having it left there on the tray. No offers of digestif, despite being listed on the menu. During the cabin darkness period, was not approached a single time to be offered a drink, hot flannel etc. The only time I saw crew during this time was when I got up to walk front to back of the plane and discovered a couple of them in the galley reading magazines. All in all, doesn't come anywhere near Emirates or Singapore, so would actively look to avoid in future for long haul.", "air_title": "Air France ", "Customer_name": "Nathan Barley"}
