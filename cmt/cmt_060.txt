The cabin had been newly remodelled and it was great. It was the first time that comfort was competing with the companies from the gulf area. It was a piece of luck, for most 777 have not been remodeled yet. Staff, food, drinks, entertainment, everything was perfect. I just pity all those who pay the same amount but do not have the same comfort.", "air_title": "Air France ", "Customer_name": "J Humeau"}
