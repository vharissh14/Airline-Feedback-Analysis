Qantas customer on codeshare, very good value at <\u00a3300 return. As reported by others patchy customer service. 2 flights excellent, 1 OK and one seemed to be run for the benefit of the crew, who all seemed very young and poorly trained. DXB is becoming a menace as it gets progressively busier. Any slightly adverse weather and it goes off-line. We were stacked 100 miles out over the Gulf for over an hour because of a thunderstorm resulting in our bagged failing to make the onward connection. Smoother on return but baggage once again failed to make the connection. As I write 3 days later its still not been delivered to me.", "air_title": "Emirates ", "Customer_name": "Patrick Gold"}
