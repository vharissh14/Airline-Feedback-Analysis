Zurich to Singapore, and back from Denpasar to Zurich via Singapore with my family. I bought the tickets online through their web site taking advantage of a special offer, they extremely cheap. Upon reservation I was immediately allowed to choose the seats and special meals (I am vegetarian). Every flight was perfectly on time or landed early. Seats are comfortable and inflight entertainment excellent. My special meal arrived at the same time of other meals, warm and very good, other meals were also good. Large variety of drinks and good wine. Several times during the flight they offered water, juices and snacks. I was travelling with a 4yr old child who was continuously spoiled by the cabin crew with gifts and additional food. We asked for sandwiches and snacks several times and they offered them immediately. Getting in the aircraft on the way back I remarked that the seat belt on my seat was broken. Ground staff arrived immediately, they dismantled the seat and changed the belt. The whole operation did not take more than 5 minutes! A special word to the cabin crew, it was not my first flight with Singapore Airlines and I am always astonished by how lovely, caring and professional they are! They are always smiling, never get nervous or stressed, and are extremely efficient, they never forget something you ask them!", "air_title": "Singapore Airlines ", "Customer_name": "Modesti Antonella"}
