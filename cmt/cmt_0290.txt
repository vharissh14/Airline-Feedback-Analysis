The females with one exception, were unsmiling and almost snatched trays from us. During meal service, flight attendants in the past always ensured the comfort of passenger dining by requesting the seats be upright but on these two flights I had to ask that this be done. Also, there was a huge rush to get a stone cold awful breakfast served before landing in Brisbane - why? Then they missed the fact that a passenger in front still had his seat reclined for landing. We noticed similar problems on a return Europe flight last year.", "air_title": "Singapore Airlines ", "Customer_name": "R Montgomery"}
