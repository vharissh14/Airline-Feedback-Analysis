Seat was very comfortable and the entertainment was great, enough for a 12 hour flight, but the flight path was not as informative as before. First flight from Zurich to Singapore, had horrible seafood menu as I ordered before and the fourth flight from Singapore to Zurich the problem was the entertainment system - we couldn't see the flight path, and the audio or video was stuck every few minutes. I did try the Wi-Fi onboard. I think $5.99 for 5 MB was far too expensive and the connection was slow. Other than that, every aspect was went very well (check in, boarding, transit, baggage handling).", "air_title": "Singapore Airlines ", "Customer_name": "S Stephen"}
