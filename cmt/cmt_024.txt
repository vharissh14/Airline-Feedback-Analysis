I was very excited to get the chance to fly this aircraft. I was totally underwhelmed by the business class seat. First, Service was good. Wine was good. Entertainment was good. But - Business class on the A380 and the seat is not a lie flat seat! I don't think I slept 20 minutes. The pitch is 81 degrees. I'm 6'5\" - which means I barely fit in the seat when it opened up - but you find yourself sliding down the whole time.", "air_title": "Air France ", "Customer_name": "Michael Lonergan"}
