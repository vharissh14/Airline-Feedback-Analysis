Selected them solely based on good reviews and 5 star status, and wanted to try their new A380 to LHR. CGK-DOH leg was in a B777-300ER, quite a new plane, great IFE with very big screen, on time departure and early arrival in Doha, very good inflight service as well. Our flight to LHR was delayed by 2 hours due to aircraft changes. It is no longer A380 but they changed it to an old A340-600, to make the matter worse despite checking in on time and getting our preferred seats (window and middle seat as we are a couple), due to the aircraft changes they put us in the middle seat of 4 between 2 other strangers. The seat layout is 2x4x2, why cant they just put us as a couple in the window/aisle seat? Aircraft is showing its age and entertainment is limited unlike the B777, service was so-so and meals are inedible. Very cramped seats and legroom is not that great compared to B777. They changed the gate twice during the delay and we had to walk from end to end at Hamad International Airport just to find out that our flight was delayed. Not a very good experience especially considering DOH-LHR is one of QR's flagship route.", "air_title": "Qatar Airways ", "Customer_name": "S Lubis"}
