It is only through desperation I use the airline now and I would willingly pay over their price to avoid it. As a frequent flyer from Saudi Arabia, I find AF charter Saudi Air flights and pass them off as their own. For me, this is unacceptable. If I wanted Saudi Air, I would book Saudi Air. The toilets are always dirty and smelly, the flight crew generally miserable and there are always extremely badly behaved kids crawling over the seats. What I've also found is the passengers here cannot wait for the plane to stop before they're out of their seats and there is no admonishment from the staff. The food is always bland and as cheap as possible, they can't even be bothered buttering the sandwiches and the excuse for dinner is laughable. There is zero inflight entertainment. I've also had occasion to speak to the staff at CDG airport, possibly the most frustrating airport in the world, and they are the rudest I have ever come across. I really dislike both Saudi Air and Air France for these reasons. I would definitely not recommend.", "air_title": "Air France ", "Customer_name": "Andy Pac"}
