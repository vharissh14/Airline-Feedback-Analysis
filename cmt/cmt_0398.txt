I also pre-ordered their in-flight meal service, which was delicious and promptly delivered once on board. On return flight, the flight was delayed by 2 hrs. but I needed to be back in KUL on time, so I booked another airline on my way back to KUL. Later I exchanged a few e- mails with their station manager in PEN, so they handled my delay costs very professionally. All in all not a bad airline to fly with around Asia. Only negative side is that they use low-cost terminal at KUL, which you can not compare with a satellite Terminal.", "air_title": "AirAsia ", "Customer_name": "Edin Dzano"}
