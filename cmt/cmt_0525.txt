Everyone, from ground staff to flight crews, was friendly and courteous. Free meals and alcohol were served, even in economy class. Personal seatback TVs had a massive selection of films. The flight crews made numerous drink runs throughout the long-haul flights - again, this is Economy Class - offering refills, even more free alcohol, and fresh water. The leg room was very generous, the seats extremely comfortable. This airline makes carriers from the USA and even Europe look very bad by comparison.", "air_title": "Qatar Airways ", "Customer_name": "J Smith"}
