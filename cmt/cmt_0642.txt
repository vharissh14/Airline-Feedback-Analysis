Both flights on time. Loved the A380 it was so spacious we sat in row 88 at the back. The A380 was really quiet too. The 777 felt more cramped and was not as comfy. The IFE is brilliant both touch screens. Finally the food. We fly long haul twice a year but the Emirates food is by far the best we have had. Can't wait to fly with them again.", "air_title": "Emirates ", "Customer_name": "M Gittens"}
