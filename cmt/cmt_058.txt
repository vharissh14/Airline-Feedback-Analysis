They speak the language of the country that they fly to as well as English and their own French. They are quick to attend, offer champagne as an aperitif, wine with your food and also a digestive cognac after they have collected your empty food tray. It's always been a pleasure flying with them.", "air_title": "Air France ", "Customer_name": "Dave Hughes"}
