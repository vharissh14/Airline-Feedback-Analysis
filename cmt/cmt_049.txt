Check-in was efficient, but that's all that I liked about the flight. I've never experienced before such an arrogant and frigid crew as on this flight. Crew did not do anything during the first two hours of the flight. They were chatting for two hours! After two hours of chatting with each other, reading newspapers, playing games on their phones and drinking coffee they decided to serve the passengers. Coffee or tea and a very small croissant were served. I expected a bit more on a flight of over three hours. After serving they were gone and I haven't seen them again. Seats were horrible in comparison to my outbound flight with KLM. The announcements were very difficult to understand. And of course they lost my baggage. After 5 days I could collect my baggage at the airport. I'll never ever in my life fly Air France again and I will never recommend them to anyone else!", "air_title": "Air France ", "Customer_name": "R Scholten"}
