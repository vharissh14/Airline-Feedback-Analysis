Flight time is 5 hours 15 mins. Due to depart at 8.40am (slightly delayed). Arrive Paris 11.55am. Seat configuration economy seats with table between. Two stewardesses assigned to business class. One older and a younger. On arrival to aircraft hand towels distributed to business class passengers. No offer of refreshments as is the norm with other airlines. Older stewardess was instead busy making herself and the younger stewardess a cup of tea/coffee. Other cabin crew come and get themselves a water. In the end I got their attention and requested a juice. The other business class passengers received nothing. No assistance with putting hand luggage (small backpack) in overhead locker on landing. Clearly having difficulty due to a pinched nerve in back and was in a lot of pain. Younger stewardess helped on departure. Older stewardess wouldn't. Instead would walk past me to abruptly point out (twice) that my hand luggage needed to go back to overhead locker for landing. Breakfast of omelette. Was grey and rubbery. Unappetising. My request for a glass of wine was refused by the older stewardess as this was \"a breakfast flight so no alcohol is served\". End of flight curtains opened and business class and economy class passengers exited together to shared bus. Have yet to work out how this could have cost me almost NZ$2,000. Would I travel with Air France again? No. Would I recommend this airline? No.", "air_title": "Air France ", "Customer_name": "H Little"}
