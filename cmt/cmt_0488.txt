Seat 4A. After an on-time departure from JNB, the bell went off to signal to the cabin crew that they could leave their jump seats to start their work in the cabin. Several passengers in the business class cabin took this as an indication that they could leave their seats, even though the seat belt sign was still illuminated. A woman in the row ahead of me got up to use the lavatory. I told her that the seat belt sign was still on, so she returned to her seat. Another passenger from row 1 started making his way down the aisle to the lavatory, so the woman in front of me said, \u0093why don't you tell him\u0094. So I also told him that the seat belt sign was still on and he returned to his seat. When the sign was eventually turned off about ten minutes later, the woman in front of me, while going to the lavatory, stopped at my seat and said, \u0093do I have your permission to go to the washroom?\u0094 Honestly, the crew should be paying more attention, not leaving it to passengers to tell other passengers when it is safe to move around the cabin. A tense atmosphere on board could and should have been avoided by the crew doing their job which, lets not forget, is first and foremost about safety, not service.", "air_title": "Qatar Airways ", "Customer_name": "M LaPrairie"}
