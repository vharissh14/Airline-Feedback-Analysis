On checking a few days before our departure I discovered the seat reservations had been cancelled by AF. Had to phone AF Heathrow who explained it was due to \"operational needs\" but he reserved us middle of the plane seats in both directions as no window seats available, on reaching CDG I asked for an explanation and was told it was a problem with Delta (flight was codeshare). On the flight despite asking for the meat option meal all we could get was the vegetarian option which was just about edible-we were 25 rows from the back. The seats were not comfortable to begin with so you can imagine how we felt after a 9 hour flight.", "air_title": "Air France ", "Customer_name": "D Robinson"}
