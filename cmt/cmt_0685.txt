Appalling start in the Bidvest 'Premier' lounge at CPT, stuffed to the gills and poor quality food and drink. FAs friendly enough on 777-300ER but dinner service slow and the 2-3-2 seats lacked privacy for a night-time flight. 4 hr stopover at DXB fine once the gate for A380 flight to LHR had been identified - no thanks to a discourteous DXB employee. A380 impressively quiet as ever and a pair of E/F seats were excellent for a couple. Lunch service again slow and the main courses inedible. Flight deck poor at updating on flight, including bad turbulence. Quick disembarkation and speedy baggage reclaim.", "air_title": "Emirates ", "Customer_name": "David Ellis"}
