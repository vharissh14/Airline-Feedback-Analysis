The 380 seating is very comfortable with full recline, the 777 is not full recline so not as comfortable. Also on the 777 we were in the front row so had the TV screen on the aisle seat in a standalone stand which reduces the access to the window seat. All flights were on time for arrival even when departure was delayed for up to 25 mins, which with relatively short transit times at DXB (<2hours) was a relief. Service on all flights was very good, as a frequent flier we were greeted and the layout of the plane, ICE controls etc explained, this a good personal touch. The food and drinks were good, the flight attendants very quick to provide refills. My wife felt unwell on the return leg DXB-BKK and the flight attendant did all she could to help, excellent service. It's over 2 years since I last flew Emirates when the standard was falling, we used other airlines but because of the lower cost and the ability to fly to LGW we chose Emirates and were pleasantly surprised, we will use them again for our next trip.", "air_title": "Emirates ", "Customer_name": "Hill Allen"}
