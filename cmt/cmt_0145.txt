Given its always significantly higher priced compared to competitors, I found it a little disappointing. As always, no complaint on the service or IFE (except once, as below), but was very disappointed with the food served on SIN-DEL leg both times (bland and just not tasty). One of the DEL-SIN flights on an A380 was a little worse than others, with the IFE system not functioning properly for a large part of the flight. It had to be reset several times before it worked. Moreover, the aircraft seemed a little worse for wear compared to the usual SQ equipment, with some seat covers coming off and the toilet barely clean. All in all, the problems were not significant, but could be a sign of SQ becoming complacent on a route on which it has little to no competition.", "air_title": "Singapore Airlines ", "Customer_name": "Devottam Sengupta"}
