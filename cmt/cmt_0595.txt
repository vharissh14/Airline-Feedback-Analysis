After reading other postings here for Emirates, just had to add my comments. I have travelled Emirates for many years, but I feel customer service from the crew is getting worse. Friendly FAs are rare these days. The others just do the minimum of what needs doing, without a smile. Almost knock you over if you are in their way. A couple of people took our seats and wouldn't move, but the FAs couldn't care less. The once fabulous selection on ICE is deteriorating too. Plenty to see, but a poor selection in English, unless you like violent movies. Whatever happened to the snack pack with a drink at the beginning of a flight? Not served on my flight. Some passengers rang for the FA, but they didn't come. Yes some might ring for minor things, but on the other hand, it could be an emergency. Annoying things on a long 14 hour trip, these small things make a difference to the passengers. Lift your game Emirates, or more people will be looking elsewhere. I firmly believe any airline is only as good as its crew. I am due another flight next week to Europe. Hope this is a better experience.", "air_title": "Emirates ", "Customer_name": "C Baxter"}
