Originally was meant to be A380-B747 outbound then A380 for both legs inbound. This was changed to B777-300 and B747 out and B777-300 in. The B777 was exceedingly cramped with very little leg room. When reclining, the seat moves forward further reducing your already limited legroom and when the passenger in front reclines, the seat back comes very close to you. Sardines in a can spring to mind. On the return trip because of the change of 'plane outbound, I checked on-line and discovered the change so for the second leg, SIN- SYD, I managed to change my seats to next to emergency door, definitely worth paying the extra. As for the seats themselves, on the B777 the seats are very hard with not much in the way of cushioning making a bad situation worse. From LHr-SIN, the in-flight entertainment was a modern touchscreen unit with an extensive choice but was extremely sensitive and with the closeness of it next to your knees, the slightest choice would activate it illuminating your area and your fellow passengers with light, not good if wanting to sleep that is if you can sleep in the crowded conditions. From SIN-SYD, the unit was an old system with very limited choice and I soon gave up with it. Having flown SIA many times before, I was really looking forward to flying with them to experience the (relative) comfort of the A380 yet again. What a disappointment! Previously whenever asked, I would say that SIA was my favourite airline but these cost-cutting measures have made me re-evaluate that.", "air_title": "Singapore Airlines ", "Customer_name": "T Kam"}
