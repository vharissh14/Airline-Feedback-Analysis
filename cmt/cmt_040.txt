Seat reservations made at time of booking had been changed when I checked in online 24 hours before the flights. No explanation offered. I found seat 2A on outbound leg much more comfortable than seat 4E on return leg. Although on a 10 hour flight with a leading European Airline one would expect a flat bed, AF do not offer this on the Paris / Caracas route. On the way out my baggage missed the connection in Paris and it took more than 2 days for AF to get it to me. No apology, no explanation, no keeping me informed. On way back delay of over three hours. Air France Business Class lounge in Caracas is atrocious, worst I have seen. IFE did not work for the first 90 minutes of the flight, despite the valiant efforts of the Purser.", "air_title": "Air France ", "Customer_name": "Barry Fines"}
