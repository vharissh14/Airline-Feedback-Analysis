We checked in several hours before our flight and were disappointed to find that we had been given seats in two different rows (my husband and I were flying with our two kids). Obviously we had hoped to sit together as a family but thought \"oh well, it's not the end of the world\". We boarded the plane and realised that we were not only in different rows but in 4 different seats. We were absolutely gob-smacked that an airline could put a 2 year old on his own! When we waved down the air hostess and explained that our son who had just turned two could not sit on his own she told us that the flight was full and we would have to take our dedicated seats. I told her that our 2 year old could not possibly sit on his own and she suggested that he sit on my lap instead. Pretty disappointing when you paid for 4 seats. Just when I thought things couldn't get much worse the food trolley came around and after placing my order for a hot meal for myself and my two kids I was told that they only accept cash and not card. I didn't have any cash on me (I had actually tried to withdraw cash at the airport but the ATM was out of order) so they told me I was unable to order any food. I said that there must be some other option as my kids were hungry and surely there was something they could do but they did not help at all. My poor kids basically spent the whole flight crying with hunger and they wouldn't even give me a bottle of water (as our water had been taken off us at the airport by security). I was basically in tears by this time and finally a kind passenger gave me $10 so I could buy something for the kids to eat. I will never fly with this airline again.", "air_title": "AirAsia ", "Customer_name": "K Porter"}
