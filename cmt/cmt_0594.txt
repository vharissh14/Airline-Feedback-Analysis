Couple of slight delays on take up but the airline made up the time and managed to land close enough to schedule. A380 all the way, which is excellent because the business class cabin allows every seat to have direct aisle access so no stepping over your neighbour. Excellent storage and your own little mini bar in each seat. Bar at the back of the plane is great for taking a break on the 14 hour leg from Dubai to Sydney. Food good and IFE the best.", "air_title": "Emirates ", "Customer_name": "Kevin Tunnicliffe"}
