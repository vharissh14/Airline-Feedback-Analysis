I must say AF mad a lot of positive progress in every way. The flight attendants and ground staff were marvellous. Friendly and always had a smile on their face. They made a drink round and served some crackers. For flights of approx. 1 hour very good. All flights were more or less on time. I will fly with them definitely again.", "air_title": "Air France ", "Customer_name": "R Thut"}
