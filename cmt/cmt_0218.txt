On one flight they shut down the cabin for sleep at 3.30 on a bright sunny afternoon, and insisted the window shade be drawn, when I would have liked to see out. After that cabin staff disappeared and only offered water twice in the next six hours or so. On two very long flights only one meal and a snack was offered, and once it took three quarters of an hour to get a second drink after meal service was over and the aisle was clear. On one flight the air con was set on an extremely high temperature, most unpleasant. We paid extra to fly with them, on the basis of their reputation for service, which was poor. Meal service was slow, and the choices of food ran out on two flights. In contrast a one hour flight with a regional airline managed to serve a full meal and two drinks between Manchester and Heathrow, so it can be done!", "air_title": "Singapore Airlines ", "Customer_name": "Angela Cockburn"}
