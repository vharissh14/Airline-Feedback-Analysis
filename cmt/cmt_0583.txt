One and a half hours delayed. No drink service offered for another one and a half hours. Dinner then served without drink, meal eaten before wine was served. On checking the menu I hate curry so informed the stewardess asking her to save me the alternative but she forgot so no main course for me. Very stressful flight due to worry about missing connection. Next year it's BA direct for us.", "air_title": "Emirates ", "Customer_name": "Clifton Pauline"}
