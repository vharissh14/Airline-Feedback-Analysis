I cannot believe that the standards have gone down so badly. I have been flying EK since 2006. Transit in Dubai - Dubai airport can be a huge one and boast of passenger numbers but the reality is that it is finding hard to cater to the growth. Terminal 3 is supposed to be exclusive for EK but why no aerobridges provided. My flight departed SIN at 01.20, landed at around 05.00 in DXB. EK parked their B777-300ER somewhere at the far end of the airport and we were made to climb down the staircase at that time. We were packed in a bus and sent to the terminal which took some 15 to 20 min. I entered the terminal at around 5.45am and walked down for security check. Finally at around 6.30am, I reached my gate B30. After the boarding pass check, guess what, we are asked to board a bus again for a 15 min ride to the far end of the airport where they have parked their B777-300ER again. There was no proper organised zonal boarding as everyone just boarded the flight through the rear door and had to queue a lot before taking the seats inside the flight. Inflight Service - The inflight service was awful. The standards have down in this area since 2010. Their food portions have gone down, I always felt hungry after the meal! Cabin crew don't want to move from their seats at all! If you want something, it is always better to go to the galley rather than wait for anyone.", "air_title": "Emirates ", "Customer_name": "S Kumar"}
