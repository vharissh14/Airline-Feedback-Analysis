Flight was delayed in Los Angeles due to incoming aircraft. In general no problem because automatic email was sent beforehand to inform passengers. But two issues: 1) They changed my ongoing flight from Paris to Berlin to a later one without telling me about it, there was no communication. 2) The LAX-CDG flight caught up with the schedule so I could have made the original connecting flight but they wouldn't change my ticket back in Paris. Watched other passengers board the plane that I booked but had to wait 4 hrs at CDG for the next flight. Ground personnel refused to hand out anything, not even a voucher for a drink or snack at the airport. I have been flying with AirFrance/KLM for many years now but I have to say that AF is loosing it's charm. Flight attendants on LAX-CDG didn't pay a lot of attention, even though I have to say that there were always plenty of drinks and snacks.", "air_title": "Air France ", "Customer_name": "N Ahlfeld"}
