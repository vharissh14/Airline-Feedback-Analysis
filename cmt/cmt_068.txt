Was flying home on an awards ticket in economy class. One set of crew from CGK- SIN and another set of crew from SIN-CDG. In spite of flying in economy class and on an awards ticket, the chief flight attendant on the CGK-SIN sector personally greeted me. This was as a result of my elite plus Sky Team Alliance status. I enjoy Indian food and had ordered an Indian meal for both sectors knowing from past experience that I would get a very good Indian meal ex. SIN. I was not disappointed with the butter chicken. Leg room was minimal and seat comfort was barely adequate for the 13 hour flight. Cabin crew were professional. In-flight entertainment was adequate but poor when compared to other 4 star airlines. Flights departed and arrived on time throughout the journey.", "air_title": "Air France ", "Customer_name": "Stephen Gervais"}
