Early morning flight (departure time 06.00), and while the standard check- in for international flights is 3 hours prior to departure time, the counter failed to be staffed until 04.20. A small irritant, yes but it was a harbinger of things to come. Ticketing and luggage handling pretty typical of any other airlines with the exception of dealing with excess baggage. Each bag is weighed and there is no leeway whatsoever. Every increment of one kilo was billed as excess baggage. They do not make this easy. The passenger must leave the queue, walk across the terminal to the Air Asia cashier, process the necessary transaction and then return to the ticket agent to complete the process. We knew we had excess weight, we had pre-purchased an additional 20 kilos of sporting equipment. The agent unilaterally decided that trekking equipment was not sporting equipment therefore, it was to be classified as excess baggage. We were forced to pay an additional 5575 baht (approximately 175.00 USD) simply based on his arbitrary determination. We pre-ordered and prepaid for an inflight meal. Their idea of a breakfast meal is a small tin of rice or noodles and a 4 oz. cup of water. It was the worst attempt at a meal I have ever witnessed. On this trip we used 10 different airlines. Did Air Asia get us to Hong Kong on time? Yes. Was the plane clean? Yes. Did we receive value for the money spent? Not even close. Of all the airline companies we flew, was AirAsia at least average? Not even close! Would we ever fly this company again, knowing now how they treat their customers? I hope we never are faced with that decision.", "air_title": "AirAsia ", "Customer_name": "D Van Hove"}
