The connection at Doha was very tight at 45 mins but I assumed that Qatar had it sorted for a quick transit. QR 002 arrived in Doha 10 minutes behind schedule so not an ideal start. It took ground staff almost 15 mins to get the first passengers off. Absolutely no help from ground personnel to fast track to connection. Despite dashing through security and arriving at the gate I was refused boarding and told that the plane had left. I know for a fact that this flight arrives in Phuket most days almost an hour ahead of schedule so why not wait for the dozen affected passengers. I booked my ticket direct with Qatar so would have expected them to assist me to make a tight connection that they sold me.", "air_title": "Qatar Airways ", "Customer_name": "Parker Tom"}
