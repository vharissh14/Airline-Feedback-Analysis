Kingfisher changed their schedules which would have meant criss-crossing India to arrive in Kolkata. Checked in at Kochi with no problem. Ground staff helpful and assured us that the seats on Air India had been booked, but we would need to collect baggage at Mumbai and re-checkin with Air India for onward flight. Kingfisher Red flight on time and adequate, although seats were more like padded wooden boards than upholstered seats. Little leg room. On arrival at Mumbai attempted to check-in with Air India only to be told that no booking had been made and the flight was full. Kingfisher staff not communicative, merely telling us to wait. After two hours we were taken to the Air India stand-by desk. After waiting another 30 minutes tickets were thrown into our hands just in time to clear security. On the positive, we got seats on the plane as promised. But until the last few minutes Kingfisher staff did nothing to keep us informed.", "air_title": "Kingfisher Airlines ", "Customer_name": "D Whalley"}
