I enjoyed every moment of the flight. A nice glass of bubbles (Dom Perignon) was offered before take off. The cabin crews were very attentive and helpful on every aspect of my flight. The food was more than adequate for me. A nice touch when a head cabin service officer apologized to me about the delay when the flight took off behind schedule from HKG, was due to late arrival to HKG from Singapore. I'll recommend this airline.", "air_title": "Singapore Airlines ", "Customer_name": "Chan Anthony Dominic"}
