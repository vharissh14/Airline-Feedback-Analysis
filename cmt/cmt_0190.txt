Flew on the A380 and booked the preferred seating for extra legroom. While this was a blessing the reduction in seat width wasn't ideal. The seats were a little too firm for my liking. Other than that the experience was fantastic. Entertainment choice was plentiful, the food was good and the cabin crew were excellent. All requests were met with a smile and service is miles ahead of other airlines.", "air_title": "Singapore Airlines ", "Customer_name": "A Barnes"}
