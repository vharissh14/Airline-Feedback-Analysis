The plane seemed very new with nice entertainment system and it was updated with the latest IFE system with a 10 inch HD screen. Seats were comfortable with lots of space to straighten your legs, cabin crew were nice and friendly and food was delicious. The next flight from DXB-BOM was on an outdated B777-300, seats were quite old including the IFE system but the content was almost the same, cabin crew were not friendly, they seemed to be in rush all the time, food was ok. On return my flight from BOM-DXB was on a B777-300ER and that was another plane with much more better seats and IFE system compared to the one I had from DXB-BOM, although the service was nice and cabin crew were better with no rushing. On the A380 from DXB-LHR the plane was the same but the seats and screen of the IFE system were the same as the B777-3ER although the whole flight was nice, was a bit disappointed with the system as the one I got from LGW-DXB was new. Will fly again with them.", "air_title": "Emirates ", "Customer_name": "S Khubchandani"}
