I pushed the service button in order to receive some water for taking medicine, the only thing that happened was that after ten minutes a Stewardess came by, switched of the service sign and went away. I pushed the button a second time and the same happened again. Furthermore there was only once service on an 8 hours flight. Food unfortunately below standard. The Entertainment System was quite ok though. Hope that I don't have to fly with Emirates again.", "air_title": "Emirates ", "Customer_name": "Kai Ostermann"}
