Overall not impressed. Expected a lot more from the Emirates name. Both journeys no wifi available or telephone onboard as advertised. The screens seems to be a bit unresponsive. Staff lacking the extra mile with far too many announcements unrelated to flight safety, really disturbing at night time. Flying just once with Emirates is probably enough.", "air_title": "Emirates ", "Customer_name": "D Vasile"}
