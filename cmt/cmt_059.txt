I will avoid this airline in the future due to the following: 1) No special meal option-no gluten free, vegetarian, peanut allergy, diabetic, etc. meals available 2) Lazy, unfriendly flight attendants. Every time there was a tiny bit of minor turbulence they flipped the seat belt light and plopped in the flight attendant seat, strapped in and took a break. This happened frequently. I sat near the galley and saw them eating ice cream, cake, feet propped up. I don't think they ever offered water or any types of beverage during the flight. Completely awful staff. 3) Plane was ragged looking and my TV did not function properly. FA said there was nothing he could do. Did not give one care about it.", "air_title": "Air France ", "Customer_name": "S Cauble"}
