My flight was on SQ 298 from Christchurch to Singapore, in general, for the price of the ticket, I expected much better. Food was very poor. For someone with high tolerance in salty food, the Chinese dinner meal (rice with pork in gravy) was very salty. Lamb stew served for lunch was undercooked. Choice of meals ran out for both lunch and dinner, and entertainment systems were surprisingly outdated (compared to other airlines with touch screen and consoles, SIA only had old fashioned consoles). Air stewardesses were decent, but not the most helpful or courteous. Having flown SIA and other airlines like Emirates, and even budget carriers in recent years, I find that the standard of SIA has been poorly maintained, and sad to say, even though I am a Singaporean who would want to support the main airline of our small country, the substandard flight service and appalling customer service I experienced this flight definitely does not live up to the price of its reputation and premium airline tickets. I would not be flying Singapore Airlines again.", "air_title": "Singapore Airlines ", "Customer_name": "Julia Lim"}
