CGK-DOH-CGK, Business, A330. First and last time. These seats are a total disaster with a major design flaw. For sitting and lounging they are OK. When going flat however the footrest goes DOWN despite plenty of space, and the midsection goes up. This gets you in a totally unnatural position. Their product on 380 and 777 is better, but avoid the 330 at any cost. Just buy and economy seat or fly another airline who better understood the needs of BC travellers.", "air_title": "Qatar Airways ", "Customer_name": "Wim Timmermans"}
