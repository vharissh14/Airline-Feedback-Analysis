Overall the flight was fabulous. From pre-take off to airborne to landing, all cabin crews make their very best effort to keep the service went well throughout the flight. Cabin crews were attentive, friendly and helpful. Cabin crews were always appeared in the cabin and went around to serve passengers some drinks and snacks after the meal services. The food was delicious. The cabin was very comfortable especially the lighting. I was lucky enough to board their brand new Boeing 777-300ER. Take off and landing were smooth without much noises. Also, the lavatory were in clean condition all the time. This is the airline worth flying with and I would recommend to the others. Although I was flying Economy class, I felt I was being treated as a business class or first class passengers.", "air_title": "Singapore Airlines ", "Customer_name": "Jonathan Hiing"}
