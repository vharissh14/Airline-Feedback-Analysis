Check-in agent was friendly. Flight was on time. The crew overall worked very hard, aside from several juniors who seemed to shadow more senior stewardess, whom need to polish further their customer focus skill. Food is of high quality (Seared duck as appetizer and steak). I skipped breakfast, which was the first meal, as I had enough breakfast from the Sydney Emirates lounge, which serves very high quality breakfast. Wine on offer inflight is of high quality. ICE entertainment system again, the best there is in the industry. A380 that is deployed in this flight is an early generation of the type, as it does not have the latest innovation such as electrically controlled window shutters, better ICE controller and slightly smaller screen. Overall a very pleasant flight and will meet the expectations of the most discerning flyer. Note to Emirates, whomever design the menu/wine list for EK flight to and out of LAX, should take note on the menu served in this flight. I got the feeling that these menu are designed by 2 different staff/divisions.", "air_title": "Emirates ", "Customer_name": "D Hiu Martin"}
