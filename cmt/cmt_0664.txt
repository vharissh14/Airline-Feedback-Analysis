As usual I found the biz product to be excellent both on A380 and on B773. VIP lounge in Milan is brand new with plenty of seats and amenities with direct separate boarding directly from the lounge. Once on board seats are very comfortable, high quality food and drinks, smiles and kindness from all the crew. The only weakness is concerning boarding procedures at Bangkok that don't allow priority at all once pre-boarded is all chaotic, so you have to literally walk over economy class passengers. EK is one of the most comfortable J class in the market, I'll fly with them again.", "air_title": "Emirates ", "Customer_name": "Bertoni Matteo"}
