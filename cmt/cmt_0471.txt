Improved legroom in coach, good entertainment and food. Cabin crew well above par. One small complaint: The free Doha city tour (layover of five hrs) a great idea and heavily hyped on their site and inflight magazine, can only accommodate twenty people at a time, and I believe only goes out every two hours. It's a joke as thousands are connecting through at any given time. (if you haven't guessed we were bumped and somewhat casually by the ground staff in Doha, who were more interested in returning to their chat than apologizing or explaining the situation).", "air_title": "Qatar Airways ", "Customer_name": "S Kalter"}
