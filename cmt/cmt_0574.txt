First time to fly Emirates. Three flights on the Boeing 777-300, one on the Airbus A380-800. 3/4 sectors typified the renowned Emirates service but DUB-DXB left a lot to be desired with surly, uninterested and even some ignorant cabin crew. Some even refused to bring water to passengers. Disgraceful conduct. The IFE system was also difficult to navigate on this sector leading to a less than satisfactory flight. However, all other sectors were extremely good, particularly service aboard the A380 from PEK-DXB. Staff were exemplary, chatty, smiling, engaging and above all courteous. Our group received complimentary champagne on two occasions during the flight. They went out of their way to make us feel at home. Space was very good, the IFE fantastic and food was excellent. All in all a wonderful experience and definitely my airline of choice for future International travel.", "air_title": "Emirates ", "Customer_name": "J Fox"}
