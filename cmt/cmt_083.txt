Had a wonderful experience with Air France. Quite honestly I am surprised that there are bad reviews with this airline. Food and French wine was superb. Service was excellent. Seats in business class extremely comfortable. I slept 6 hours straight from SFO to Paris. I would with Air France again and look forward to it.", "air_title": "Air France ", "Customer_name": "Christina Wilson"}
