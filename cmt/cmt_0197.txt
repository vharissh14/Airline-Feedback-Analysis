The two things that really set SQ apart are the catering and staff service. This is really excellent food, nice drinks, and perfect service. Changi airport also remains a nice hub, but starts showing its age. However, coming back to SQs, one cannot deny that the seats and IFE are not on par anymore with big rival Emirates, with whom I flew the outbound leg. I actually quite liked the older style seat on the SQ 777-200ER in a 2-2-2 layout, which is perfectly fine, and even better than Emirates' product on their 777s. But I still do not like the very wide seat in 1-2-1 as can be found on SQ's 77W and A380. The seat is not good for lounging, to wide and short for sitting, and in order to use the ottoman one must sit diagonally and lacks good support in the back. Also, having to stand up in order to convert the seat into a bed (and back), is not practical. The bed is hard and too short for me (I am 192cm). The IFE cannot compete anymore versus what the ME carriers are offering. Smaller screen, less choice, and most unexplainable: no IFE on offer before take-off, while with other carriers one can board early and already enjoy half a movie before boarding, taxi and take-off are over. Anyway, flying business with SQ is of course still a treat, but others do much better today. Am curious to discover SQ's new business class product, which is now being rolled out for its longer range routes.", "air_title": "Singapore Airlines ", "Customer_name": "T Ney"}
