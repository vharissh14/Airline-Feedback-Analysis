Booked premium economy for me and my wife, 11.20pm. Take off on time - so far so good. The premium economy seat does not recline, it just slides down a bit and a metal support strut for the seat in front is just where you want to put your foot. The seat is also hard and uncomfortable with what seems to be a metal bar running across the middle. Place the pillow under buttock to try to relive the pain. A full hour passed without any cabin staff making a appearance, no aperitif no drink, no nothing! Eventually some hour and ten minutes later a hostess brings a tray of food which has no resemblance to something you can actually eat, one small bottle of vino and half a cup of coffee. That's it, lights out and we never see anyone again until about 8.30am. No sleep at all, the most uncomfortable flight ever. By 9am we are presented with more awful food and anther half cup of coffee. The return journey was no better and now we are awaiting our luggage as for some reason it did not fly with us. The touch screen inflight entertainment has a mind of its own and would not work properly. A real let down for the price.", "air_title": "Air France ", "Customer_name": "Clive Howarth"}
