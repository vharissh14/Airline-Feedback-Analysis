Flew the 4 sectors on 777-300 ER recently in Economy. They do a lot of things very well, but Seating, Inflight Entertainment and Beverages really harm their efforts. Seating is reasonable but what a nonsense, on all 4 sectors, the recline was! Goes back much too far, clears any food and drink off of the table into the lap of the person behind, I saw it happen twice and had a very narrow escape myself! When food and drink are not an issue, the screen on a fully reclined seat is too much in your face. Drinks were infrequent and if you ordered a Spirit mixer eg. gin & tonic, they mixed it for you, (in varying strengths) rather than give you the standard small spirit bottle and separate mixer. Small point, but again, not 5 star standard. Inflight entertainment was good but not great. These are like for like comparisons, if the price and schedules are better with Qatar, then you may prefer to overlook these issues. Drinks and IFE are small irritations but compared to others, they are falling short.", "air_title": "Qatar Airways ", "Customer_name": "L Buttle"}
