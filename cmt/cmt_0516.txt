First time I've flown with Qatar Airways. I would not hesitate in recommending them. I believe this is the best economy class flight I have been on. Spacious seating, tasty food and friendly attentive staff. I have experience of long haul flights where the cabin crew get the service out of the way as quickly as possible and then disappear behind a curtain for the rest of the flight. This was not like that at all. They were helpful throughout the flight. I was very impressed.", "air_title": "Qatar Airways ", "Customer_name": "Doug Slowman"}
