It was a midnight flight. No announcements to update status until 3 hours after departure time. Handled the exit and collection of luggage in a messy manner. Worst airline that io have ever taken. Unprofessional and doesn't care about passengers. Only having profit in mind. Didn't even care for passenger carrying sleeping child. They have to queue in a messy manner to collect departure card from AirAsia ground crew.", "air_title": "AirAsia ", "Customer_name": "L M Choong"}
