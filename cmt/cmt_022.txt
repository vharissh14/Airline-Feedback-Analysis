AF has the nerve to advertise their new business class seat on billboards in Dakar, knowing full well that they are not available on its DKR-CDG service and won't be for the foreseeable future. That's just the start. The boarding is a shambles, but that's more the fault of the airport than AF, probably (a quick congratulations to Dakar airport authorities on the overall organisation. Great idea to have most of the customs counters unmanned at peak time, loved the chance to ponder the beauty of the building during the 30 minute wait). Once in the plane you realise that AF apparently cannot manage to get someone to vacuum clean the cabin before passengers are corralled in. Dirty, and it's like that regularly! Sheer neglect and laziness. Still, the crumbs and detritus on the floor are in-keeping with the ageing and shabby cabin, which for reasons I'm yet to understand, is invariably full. Service is haphazard, and characterised mainly by its slow pace. Can't a meal be served within the first hour of a 5-hour flight? Apparently not. I was asked 3 times by three different cabin staff to endure the 'breakfast' service an hour out of Paris, a 'no' each time finally got the message across. One male steward was helpful, the others behaved like it was all too much trouble. Main meal mediocre, wine OK. Overall, glad it's not me paying the tickets.", "air_title": "Air France ", "Customer_name": "Phillip Harris"}
