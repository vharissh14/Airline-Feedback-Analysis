My experience was very mixed. The plane itself was great, the cabin was roomy, the food was good and the in-flight entertainment selections were excellent. The experience was however completely ruined by the crew. I found them, without exception, to be rude, surly, irritable and they simply did not listen or make eye contact. It was clear they did not want to be there. Clearly aiming to work only in business and first class and had absolutely no respect whatsoever for economy class passengers. They need to learn manners, to understand the importance of respect and that while they may fly around the world all the time, some people might save a life time for a trip. Does my experience really make a difference in the grand scheme of things? Probably not but they really took the special shine off my reason to travel and two in particular were spectacularly rude. A discredit to a wonderful brand and airline. A smile and a warm welcome go a long way, there was none of this on my flight! I will not choose to fly with Emirates again.", "air_title": "Emirates ", "Customer_name": "D Hill"}
