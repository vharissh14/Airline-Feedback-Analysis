We were in the second Business Class cabin on the upper deck. We had a very handsome, friendly all-male crew who provided a nice, if not amazing, service on the 11-hour flight. Seats are not lie flat, but still very comfortable, affording me a long sleep. The food was good, if unmemorable. The IFE provided a decent selection, but is not comprehensive enough to be competitive with the top airlines. Overall, this was a nice flight. There was nothing too spectacular about it, but I would fly in Business with them again (especially now that they are upgrading to lie-flat seats).", "air_title": "Air France ", "Customer_name": "Michael Bragg"}
