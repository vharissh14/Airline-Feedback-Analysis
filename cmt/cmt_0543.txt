All flight except Jo'burg - Doha on 777. The standard of service in business class on all flights was very good. The best being the Doha - Perth flight were the flight attendants were particularly attentive. All food on all flights was excellent. Again the food on the Perth - Doha flight was particularly good. Found the 787 seats from Joburg to Doha more comfortable than the 777. You did not need a mattress on this flight as the seat in the lie flat position is so well padded. I love the pod with the extra table room and the shoe storage area. Even with the mattress double thick on the 777 you can still not sleep comfortably on your side. Did not have this problem on the 787. All flights were on time or early. Not a huge fan of the new business class lounge at Hamad Int'l. Not as well designed or sign posted inside as it should be. The seating is great but the design does not flow for me. Will continue to fly with Qatar as they offer one of the best business class products in the air.", "air_title": "Qatar Airways ", "Customer_name": "Clark Karen"}
