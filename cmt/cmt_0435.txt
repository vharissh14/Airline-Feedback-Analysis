I found the process of check-in well organized and tolerable. A low cost airline is going to have large crowds to manage and they did a good job. The seats are tight, but no worse than more expensive airlines. Ads are tedious, but I am sure these keep the cost down. All in all a satisfactory experience. They got us where we wanted to go efficiently and on schedule. Isn't that what a \"Now everybody can fly\" airline supposed to do?", "air_title": "AirAsia ", "Customer_name": "P Finkbiner"}
