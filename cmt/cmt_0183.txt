SQ402 - Oct 1. SQ5357, Oct 24. SQ16 - Oct 25 2014. I have been flying SQ from San Francisco to India since 1990, when they had their 747-400 Megatop, almost once or twice a year. Other airlines have cut down on service, rudeness of the cabin crew has increased and fares have skyrocketed. In SQ, the service and amenities always amaze me, a very polite and professional crew and new equipment. The only complaint I have is how they serve the meals in the Economy class. Special Meals like Asian Vegetarian almost begins an hour before the regular meals and passengers on Long Haul Flights need to be sitting with an upright seat for more than 90 minutes with an empty tray in front of them. Aperitifs for Specials Meals are served well after 30 minutes after their meal when the food/drinks cart makes it way. Similarly the dessert (which is usually ice cream) comes an hour after meals.", "air_title": "Singapore Airlines ", "Customer_name": "Krish Mohan"}
