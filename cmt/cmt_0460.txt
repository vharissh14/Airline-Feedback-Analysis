At Delhi airport the lounge was a building site with drilling, hammering and intolerable noise. Staff were wiping dust from bottles. We asked to use a different lounge, the staff ran around for about half an hour, to no avail, whilst we waited at the entrance. Onboard the advertised champagne had not been loaded, \"catering issues\", food was canteen style, just 1 white wine, 2 red wines served chilled as was the port, the cabin was shabby with bare patches on the upholstery and dirty. The entertainment system on 2 of the seats did not work so I moved 3 times. Not 1st class in any shape or form.", "air_title": "Kingfisher Airlines ", "Customer_name": "M Bates"}
