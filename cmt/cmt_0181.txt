The check in from Soekarno-Hatta and Changi was handled quickly, but it took a little bit longer in Suvarnabhumi. Staff were friendly and hospitable. The inflight entertainment was wonderful! I like their travel magazine. The economy seats were standard but kind of uncomfortable (for me). The food was good with an average portion. There were no delays and they gave me and my family, who were also travelling with me, a S$20 voucher for every passenger (didn't know what promo that was). The price was also satisfactory and worth the flight experience. Will definitely fly with SQ again.", "air_title": "Singapore Airlines ", "Customer_name": "Layla Maharani"}
