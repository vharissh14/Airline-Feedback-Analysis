Seat 4K on JNB-DOH on Dreamliner. On boarding, went to lavatory to put on sweat pants and a tee-shirt and was offered on the way in a clothes hanger by the purser for the clothes I was changing out of. Nice touch. He came around and introduced himself to each biz passenger. One arm rest wouldn't move with the electronic function. Next thing I knew there was an engineer member of the ground staff lying in the aisle looking under my seat with a flashlight. Couldn't fix the problem, but he sure tried. Food and service during the flight were excellent. Just before arrival in DOH, the purser informed me that I would miss my connection to KWI and had been rebooked on a later flight. A member of the ground staff met me on disembarkment in DOH and took me immediately to the gate for my KWI flight which was delayed anyway due to fog in KWI. Lots of good attention from QR on these flights. I like the 1-2-1 seating in biz class on the 787.", "air_title": "Qatar Airways ", "Customer_name": "M LaPrairie"}
