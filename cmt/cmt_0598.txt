EK006 was excellent, the food was great, the entertainment system and the service was fantastic! EK584 I sat on 40A, in the back cabin of the aircraft, there were empty seats but only the window seats are full. This means that I had the whole row to myself to rest my legs and sleep properly while lying down! EK584 was the best flight of my Emirates trip!", "air_title": "Emirates ", "Customer_name": "Saif Rahman"}
