Both flights in economy class and were excellent. The first flight was on an Airbus 330 and the second on an Airbus 340. The cabin attendants were friendly and helpful. A small wet towel to freshen up after wake up would have been nice before we ate breakfast. Both flights were punctual. Food was as good as can be expected on a flight. The new Hamad Airport in Doha can only be described as superb in every way. My next journey will be on 3rd February LHR-DOH-KTM and two further round trips expected this year. I will continue to use Qatar Airways.", "air_title": "Qatar Airways ", "Customer_name": "A M Slark"}
