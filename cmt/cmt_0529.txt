Overall a very pleasant experience, as the flight was clean and new, the staff were extremely friendly, and I loved the special meal options. We all had our own TV screens as well, which was really entertaining. The only negative thing about Qatar Airways is that the legroom is very limited which disappointed me, as I really needed some leg room to relax as I am 185 cm tall (a very normal height here in Europe). I hope Qatar Airways will provide some more legroom to its passengers.", "air_title": "Qatar Airways ", "Customer_name": "Khaton Khazeema"}
