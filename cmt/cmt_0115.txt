The first impression on arrival at the Madrid airport early in the morning was terrible. Complete chaos, people standing in 3 queues, pushing around and arguing with staff. I must say there were only 3 persons wearing Air France uniforms. They were rude, not attentive at all, returning you to another queue as there were other flight checking in before our flight at 7am to Paris. We flew business class but were not allowed to go directly to the Premium counter, nobody really checked our tickets. Some staff were chit chatting instead of helping other customers. At boarding another chaos, no proper staff there either. The flight was delayed and we arrived just in time to rush to our gate for the flight to Montreal. CDG is so big and the staff there so difficult, so slow and we were asked for passports 4 times! The long haul flight was ok, food was ok, and the IFE was ok. Nothing special and nothing to be mentioned. Considering expensive business fare, I would expect much more. Lounge in Madrid was poor, the one in Paris OK and on return the Montreal lounge was again just OK. Will try Swiss next time.", "air_title": "Air France ", "Customer_name": "Joanna Graff"}
