All in all nice flights with very good cabin service and an unbeatable Changi Airport. Positive: Staff very attentive and professional, food of good quality, good IFE, reliability and safety. Great and well-priced stop-over program which has a lot to offer. Negatives: Though seat pitch of 32 in is not bad, the seats on the A380 are not very comfortable, sleeping is quite difficult. For the price you pay for SIA they could have gone easily for 33-34 inches. The cabin is wide and silent, the windows are a bit far from the seat. The food is nice, though i ate better food on Qatar for example. The 777-200 are a bit old and worn out, not up to date. Though SIA is one of the best airlines I've flown with, I don't think they offer the best Economy experience, there are better products on the markets like Qatar, Asiana or Garuda or Malaysia Airlines.", "air_title": "Singapore Airlines ", "Customer_name": "Khalid Ahmed"}
