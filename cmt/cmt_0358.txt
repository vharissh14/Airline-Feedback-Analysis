First time on Air Asia. A320 arrived late but plane was turned around quicker than normal. Gate agents never said anything about the delay which I hate - just say the flight is late. We departed 20 minutes late and arrived in Siem Reap about 10 minutes late. Short 50 minute flight. Plenty of leg room (I'm 175 cm) and had a seat in the middle open so plenty of room. Flight attendants very friendly. Didn't eat or drink but snacks looked reasonably priced. Luggage was off quickly - immigration took forever but that isn't Air Asia's fault. Very nice airline and flew a couple days later again.", "air_title": "AirAsia ", "Customer_name": "D Graubard"}
