The check-in was quite comfortable for me. Considering the fact that I have some health issues pertaining to my back, I was allotted a bulkhead seat with extra-leg space for the BRU-DOH 8 hour long sector. The welcoming by the cabin crew was very appealing and we were served with fresh towels and candies. The in-flight entertainment was also good since they had movies and other audio-visuals in the most updated forms. The food served was very delicious and was specifically served to me as per my special request for food. All the cabin crew were very pleasant and had a smiling face all the time which was very warming for everyone. The only drawback here was that the cabin crew, being English speaking, could not communicate with the mostly French and Dutch speaking passengers. Overall, I recommend it for further trip. I have my return leg with Qatar Airways and will update you soon about my other experience.", "air_title": "Qatar Airways ", "Customer_name": "Pillai Sreenath"}
