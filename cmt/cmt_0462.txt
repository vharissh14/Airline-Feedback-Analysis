What a nice experience-even quieter than the giant A380, this is a lovely plane and very nice interior that, whilst is very similar to the 787, is another level up in terms of classiness-next flight was on a 787 from Doha-Singapore. Looking forward to our return journey on the A350. Also worth noting that routing FRA-SIN was so much cheaper than LHR-SIN - but more hassle to get a connecting BA flight from LhR to FRA but, for the 3 of us, it saved several thousand pounds!", "air_title": "Qatar Airways ", "Customer_name": "Peter Lewis"}
